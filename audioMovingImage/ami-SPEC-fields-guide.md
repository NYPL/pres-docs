<br>
<br>
1. Group
    - Use as a way of grouping items topically (e.g. recitals, interviews, compositions, live performances, studio recordings, etc). This is used to identify the itemsâ€™ intended series, and to clarify the arrangement within the larger collection.
2. Title or Label Text
    - Transcribe from original media. All non-title information, such as tracklists and credits, should be recorded in the Content Notes field. Subtitles can be entered in the title field after a dash or colon. If there is no title, please use untitled or unidentified.
3. Sequence
    - This field is only used for multiple parts of the same title. For example, if a performance was recorded on three consecutive cassette tapes. If more clarity is needed, include this in the Content Notes field.
4. Content Date
    - Enter the date using [DACS](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html) formatting, (Year Month Day, e.g. 1998 March 15). If the exact date is not known, use circa or a date range to indicate an estimated or approximate date. If the media is not labeled and no date can be determined, leave the date field blank. Never use the term undated or unknown. 
5. Generation
    - Auto-populated as Original. Only edit if the item is labeled differently (Duplicate, Preservation Master, etc.)
6. Manufacturer
    - Media brand name, from primary carrier, not containers.
7. Time
    - Enter the stock time of the item (e.g. audio cassettes are often 60 or 90 minutes), not the run time. Time should always be entered in minutes.
8. Diameter
    - For audio reels, video reels, and grooved media. Leave this field blank for all other formats. Enter only numbers, measuring in inches.
9. Content Notes
    - Transcribe all information from the media enclosure or the media itself that describes the content of the item. This is important for future description because the original media will be sent to ReCAP. Clarify any abbreviations used by the creator, if you are familiar with them.
10. Preservation Notes
    - Note any conservation issues as well as technical details that could be useful for transfer. Some examples of technical details include speed, channels, track number, and video system if noted (i.e. NTSC, PAL, SECAM).
