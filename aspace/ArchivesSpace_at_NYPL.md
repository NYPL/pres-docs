# ArchivesSpace at NYPL
ArchivesSpace is an open-source content management system used to manage archival description and archival metadata. While ASpace has functionality that includes accessioning, collections management, digital object management, and public access, at NYPL we only use ArchivesSpace for description. Below is an explanation of what ArchivesSpace is and is not used for at NYPL. 

## ASpace at NYPL **IS** Used For

**Creating and Managing Finding Aids**

- Archival description of all formats, including Born-Digital and Audio and Moving Image

- [DACS](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/) compliant metadata creation

- [EAD](https://www.loc.gov/ead/eadschema.html) based metadata structure

**Exporting** [**EAD**](https://www.loc.gov/ead/eadschema.html) **and** [**MARCXML**](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/)

**Creating and Managing Access Terms and Authorities**Â 

- Agents (people and corporate bodies)

- Subjects (Topical, Genre/Form, Occupations, Uniform Titles)

**Managing Containers**

- Create containers

- Assign barcodes

- Attach containers to collections


## ASpace at NYPL is **NOT** Used For

**Collection Management**Â 

Collection management at NYPL is managed in [SPEC](https://sites.google.com/nypl.org/specialcollections/spec), which is used for both [location management](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Location_Management.html) and [accessioning](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Accessioning.html).

**Circulation and Public Access**

At NYPL, finding aids are published on the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) by Archival Processing unit management and Archives Portal administrators by exporting EAD from ASpace and uploading it to the portal. All uploads and revisions to the portal are also tracked and versioned in a system managed by the Archival Processing unit.Â 

Processing archivists create catalog records in [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/) and the [Research Catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/collections/articles-databases/nypl-research-catalog) by exporting MARCXML records from ArchivesSpace, uploading them to OCLC Connexion, and exporting those records to [Sierra ðŸ”’](https://sites.google.com/a/nypl.org/sierramanual/nypl-sierra-manual).

[Aeon ðŸ”’](https://lair.nypl.org/-/departments/library-sites-and-services/research-libraries/special-collections-aeon-implementation/aeon-resources-documentation) is managed by NYPL Collections Access and Discovery department, and is used by public service staff to facilitate requests and circulation tracking workflows for collection materials.

**Searching Legacy Description**

When NYPL implemented ArchivesSpace for description in 2017, legacy description was not imported. All Pre-2017 archival description was created in other systems and uploaded to the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/). While legacy finding aids have been, and continue to be imported into ASpace on an ad-hoc basis, usually as part of the Archival Processing unitâ€™s Description Remediation program, most legacy finding aids are only available on the Archives Portal. Therefore, the Archives Portal is the best place to search for all finding aids produced by NYPL.Â
