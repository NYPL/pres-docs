# ArchivesSpace Terminology

This section details the terms used in the ASpace application and when discussing archival description Aspace.

## Resource
 A **resource** is ArchiveSpace’s name for an archival collection. 

## Archival Object 
An **archival object** is another term for an archival component, which generally refers to the individual components in a container list. Archival objects can only belong to a single _resource_.

## Instance
An **instance** is an archival container housing _archival objects_. 

Instances are linked to _archival objects_ in ASpace. The most common types of instances are box, folder, tube, and volume.

## Repository
A **repository** refers to a _division_ or _curatorial unit_. 

In ASpace each repository is separate and contains both _resources_ and _instances_. You can only work in and search in one repository at a time, and you cannot search for _resources_, _archival objects_, or _instances_ that are not in your selected repository 

## Identifier
An **identifier** is a unique ID that can be attached to a _resource_ and/or _archival object_. 

Examples of _identifiers_ include: classmark, collection number, AMI identifier, electronic record identifier, and bnumber.

## Agent
An **agent** is ASpace’s name for a [controlled access term](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Controlled_Access_Terms.html) that is a name or corporate body. 

Agents and Subjects can be linked to many _resources_ across all _repositories_.
