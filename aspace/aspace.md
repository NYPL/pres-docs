Internal Documentation is currently available in the [ArchivesSpace User Guide ðŸ”’](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRYbYRTR_ynE1_H6LXVeIwYP4l9AfcNiK5KMD_I4gdw/edit?usp=sharing). 

This documentation was created by the Archival Processing unit and is intended to be used by all NYPL ArchivesSpace users. This documentation should be consulted in conjunction with the [Archival Processing manual](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/archivalProcessing.html), which details standards and workflows for archival description that is created in ArchivesSpace. 

The ArchivesSpace staff instance is managed by the [Archival Processing](https://sites.google.com/nypl.org/specialcollections/special-collections-processing/archival-processing) unit and Preservation and Collections Processingâ€™s [Systems and Operations](https://sites.google.com/nypl.org/specialcollections/systems-and-operations) team.Â 

NYPLâ€™s instance of ArchivesSpace is hosted by [Lyrasis](https://lyrasis.org/archivesspace-hosting/), an organization that specializes in hosting and supporting ASpace. Lyrasis assures that our ASpace instance is running correctly, and also assists with upgrades, customizations, and plugin maintenance. All communications with Lyrasis are initiated and managed by Archival Processing management and PCP Systems and Operations.

NYPL is currently using a highly customized instance of ArchivesSpace 2.5, but actively testing features in version 4.0, which is the most current version of ASpace. This guide is written for use with ArchivesSpace 2.5 and all of its local customizations. We also recommend consulting ArchivesSpaceâ€™s own [User Manual](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/909934631/ArchivesSpace+User+Manual) and [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/@archivesspace5340), which are created, managed, and maintained by the [ArchivesSpace Community](https://archivesspace.org/). 

We also recommend that all ArchivesSpace users register for the [ArchivesSpace Help Center](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/overview), which provides additional resources and insight from the ASpace community. The Help Center is available to all ASpace users of ASpace member institutions.Â
