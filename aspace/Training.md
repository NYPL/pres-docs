# ArchivesSpace Training
ArchivesSpace trainings can be scheduled by contacting the Archival Processing unit. For new staff, we recommend scheduling a joint SPEC/ASpace training session, which is facilitated by the Archival Processing unit and Systems and Operations. For additional context we recommend reviewing ArchivesSpaceâ€™s [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/@archivesspace5340) and signing up for the [ArchivesSpace Help Center](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/overview).
