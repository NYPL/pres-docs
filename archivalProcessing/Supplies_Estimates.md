If the collection has unique supplies needs, such as an uncommon box size, extensive oversized folders, or will require a large amount of a certain container size, note that here. It is better to plan ahead and have the materials on hand, than to have to order them in the middle of processing, which could potentially disrupt your proposed timeline. If your collection does not have any specific supplies needs, then you do not need to complete this field.

Consult with your supervisor about your supplies needs, and then add your request to the Archival Processing unitâ€™s supplies request document. The Archival Processing unit works collaboratively to compile all supplies orders, which are shared with the Library Administrative Associate by Archival Processing unit management. See the [Workflow for Placing Supplies Orders in the Archival Processing Unit]() document for more detailed information about the supplies ordering process.
