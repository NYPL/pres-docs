# Printing Labels
Before your collection can be shelved or shipped, you must print labels for each container in the collection, including boxes, volumes, tubes, and oversized folders. Document boxes, volumes, and oversized folders require a single label, while flat boxes, tubes, and record cartons require two labels. Remember document boxes, flat boxes, and tubes will also require two barcodes. See the Collection Management's Visual Guide document for more information about Barcode Placement Guidelines.

You should wait to print labels until after your finding aid has been approved in case you need to make any changes. Before you print your labels, make sure the collection title and [call number](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Processing_Proposal.html#division-call-number-dacs-21) are both correct, and that there is a call number in the identifier field. 

Labels can be printed in SPEC and ASpace. When printing labels for a newly processed collection, it is recommended you always print the labels in ASpace. To print labels in ASpace, select manage top containers from the setting menu on the top right.

Type in for your collection name in the _Manage Top Container_ resource search box, and select search.

ASpace will generate a list of all your collectionâ€™s containers. Select all the labels you wish to print, and choose _print labels_ from the _bulk operations_ menu on the right.

ASpace will generate a PDF of the labels, which you can then print on label paper.

# Barcoding Collections
All processed collections must be barcoded before EAD and Catalog records can be created, and before the collection can be shipped. Consult Collection Management's [visual guide ðŸ”’ ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FiHAQ0Ywdkbn_iyP6o1szZ6f0karvNhLiG-ggGDumDM/edit?usp=sharing) to see how to properly barcode all the containers in your collection. See the [Bulk Container Management](aspace/aspace.md) section of the ArchivesSpace documention for instructions on how to add barcodes to collection containers in ASpace. 

Barcodes are located on the supplies shelves. If you have collection containers that require two barcodes, be sure to use duplicate barcode sheets. You can order additional barcodes from the BookOps cataloging tab in ServiceNow.
