# Appraisal Recommendations
This is where you should record the separation and transfer recommendations [[DACS 5.3](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/06_chapter_05/03_appraisal_destruction_and_scheduling_information.html)] noted during the survey and appraisal process. Be sure to include justification for your recommendations. If the collection contains commercial media, published books, or periodicals, the curatorial unit may want these items transferred to them for further review or description. Use this field to summarize the types of materials that could be transferred. 

## Schomburg Format Separations
If you are working on a Schomburg collection, this is where you should describe your plan to separate the collection according to the research center’s divisional format policies. Schomburg collections are separated according to the formats collected by their five research divisions, each of which serves collection materials from their own reading rooms. The chart below gives an overview of the formats each division collects. If you are working on a Schomburg Photographs and Prints (SCP/P&P) or Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books (SCM/MARB) collection that includes Audio and Moving Image material that will be transferred to Schomburg Moving Image and Recorded Sound (SCL/MIRS), consult the [MIRS Separated Audio and Moving Image workflow]().
