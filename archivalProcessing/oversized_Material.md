# Oversized Materials
_Oversized_ is a physical classification of material for storage purposes, not an intellectual designation in archival arrangement. _Oversized_ refers to paper and photographic materials that do not fit in a standard-size document box. The Archival Processing unit has a large selection of oversized flat boxes and folders onsite in various sizes. 

Larger-format papers and photographs should be placed in folders by size, and those folders should be housed in a flat box. While oversized items will be physically arranged separately from the rest of the collection, they should be intellectually arranged and described within the context of the rest of the collection. An oversized box of photographs, for example, will be described as photographs, not as oversized material, and will be arranged in intellectual order, even if the box or folder numbers are out of sequence from the rest of the photographs.

Papers and photographs that are larger than the largest flat box (28 ½” x 22 ½” x 3”) should be placed in oversized folders. Folder information (title, date(s), box and folder number) should be recorded on the open end of the folder, rather than near the crease. Oversized folders should also include a barcode. 

## Guidelines for Working with Oversized Materials
Always attempt to leave the numbering of oversized boxes until the end, so that these boxes are assigned the highest box numbers in the collection.

## Flat Boxes
When using flat boxes for oversized material, use boxes as close in size to the items as possible. Items can be damaged when housing is too large or too small. 

## Oversized folders

If an item is too large for a flat box, it should be placed in an oversized folder.

Oversized folders are never sent to ReCAP. These are shipped via the Registrar to their respective curatorial divisions, where they are stored in map cases. Folders that are ready to be shipped should be placed in the map cases in the stacks. Make sure to update the folder’s location in SPEC so the Collection Manager can find the items.

Folded items should remain folded and be placed into an appropriately sized folder. Unfolding items can potentially create unnecessary damage that is irreversible. Consult with your supervisor if you think something needs to be unfolded and preserved flat. 

## Tubes
Large rolled posters should remain rolled and be placed in tube boxes. 

## Archival Bags

Items and artifacts that are too large for folders or boxes may be placed in archival bags, and labeled and barcoded just like a box. Consult with your supervisor and Collection Management before housing archival materials in bags to assure this is the best storage solution.
