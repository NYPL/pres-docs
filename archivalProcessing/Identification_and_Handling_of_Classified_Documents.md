# Identification and Handling of Classified Documents

When classified government documents are found in collections, they must immediately be separated, moved to a secure location, and restricted. This section explains how to identify a classified government document, and the steps to take when one is identified. 

## Identifying a Classified Government Document

A classified government document is defined by the following characteristics:Documents created by:
* US federal government

* Employees of the United States federal government in their capacity as employees

* Contractors working on behalf of the United States federal government

Documents that contain information related to the national security of the United States.

Documents that contain classification markings that include the terms:* Top Secret

* Secret

* Confidential

Documents that contain restricted markings related to atomic secrets such as:

* Restricted Data

* Formerly Restricted Data

Documents that contain classification markings that have not been struck on the face of the document (i.e. no line through the classification marking).

Documents that do not contain a stamp stating that the document is declassified (declassified documents will have a _declassified_ stamp, and include a date and the name of the person or agency that declassified the document.)

## What to Do When a Classified Document in Found

Materials that include the characteristics listed above must never be made available to the public. If you believe you have found a classified government document in your collection, notify your supervisor immediately. Your supervisor will review the document, and then you should work together to contact NYPL legal. You should include the following information in your email to NYPL legal:

* Use the subject line: _Potential Classified Documents Found: \[collection name]_

* Include the name of the collection and Archives Portal link (if applicable) in the body of the email

* Include the classification level and number of documents you found

* DO NOT include a description of the documents’ content in the initial email
