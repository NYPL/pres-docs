# **Processing Audio and Moving Image Material**
The arrangement and description of audio and moving image (AMI) material utilizes many of the same guiding principles as other archival materials, but involves additional steps because AMI is described on the item level to facilitate digitization for long-term preservation and access. This section details the tasks and special considerations that are necessary when working with AMI in archival collections, and addresses identification, inventory, and housing of these materials. The Media Preservation Services department facilitates and coordinates the preservation and digitization of AMI. See the [Media Preservation Documentation Portal](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/) for further information about the ways in which media is digitized and preserved. 

## **Paper Materials in Audio and Moving Image Containers**
As you inventory and describe AMI, remove any loose papers and documentation found inside a media enclosure, and place these in a folder labeled with the identifier number of the Media Original item. By retaining this information, you will be able to describe the paper and AMI together in the finding aid. It is generally best to integrate each separated paper into the container list. For some legacy collections where the papers have already been separated and their origin is unclear, you may need to create a file with a title such as, _Separated Papers_, that includes all the separated items.Â
