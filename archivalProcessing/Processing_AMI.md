# **Processing Audio and Moving Image Material**
The arrangement and description of audio and moving image (AMI) material utilizes the same guiding principles as other archival materials, but involves additional steps and procedures regarding inventory, handling, and storage. This section details the tasks and special considerations that are necessary when working with audio and moving image material. The Manager of Audio and Moving Image Description and the Media Preservation Services department facilitates and coordinates the preservation and digitization of these materials. See the [Media Preservation Documentation Portal](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/) for further information about the ways in which media is digitized and preserved. 

## **Audio and Moving Image Inventory**
While the Archival Processing unit is responsible for description in finding aids of AMI included in archival collections, an initial inventory is performed in SPEC as part of the accessioning process by Collection Management. This includes assigning identifier numbers and barcodes in, rehousing items, and recording the format type. Since AMI is the only format routinely arranged and described on the item level, processing collections with AMI can be significantly more time consuming. Inventories and collection documentation provided by the donor or seller can be helpful, as it can often assist in deciphering the content of inadequately labeled media. In many cases, this information can be repurposed in the finding aid description, or included as an additional resource to the finding aid. In the Archival Processing unit, the inventory of AMI in archival collections is performed by exporting a spreadsheet of the initial Collection Management inventory, and enhancing it with bibliographic data. During the inventory, if you encounter incorrect formats, you should correct the record in SPEC. The completed inventory will be imported into ArchivesSpace. See the section on Importing an Audio and Moving Image Inventory into ArchivesSpace for instructions on how to do this.

## **Identification**

There are many resources that can aid in identifying the audio and moving image materials in a collection. Some helpful identification resources are listed below. If you are unable to identify any of the media in your collection, talk to your supervisor and contact the Manager of Audio and Moving Image Description.

**All Formats**

[University of Illinois Preservation Self-Assessment Program](https://psap.library.illinois.edu/collection-id-guide/#audiovisual) is a helpful guide for identifying most common audio and moving image formats.

The [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats) preservation site has a section on archival formats, which includes sections for [audio](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/audio-toc.html), [video](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/video-toc.html), and [film](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/motion-picture-film-toc.html). [The Museum of Obsolete Media](https://obsoletemedia.org/) is helpful if you encounter less common or rare audio and moving image formats.

**Video**

The Texas Commission on the Arts [Videotape Identification and Assessment Guide](https://www.arts.texas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/video.pdf) is a useful resource for information about all video tape formats.

**Film** 

Brian Pritchard’s site has a [guide](http://www.brianpritchard.com/IMPF.htm) to identifying both [16mm](http://www.brianpritchard.com/16mm%20Identification%20Version%201.02.pdf) and [35mm](http://www.brianpritchard.com/35mm%20Film%20Identification%20Version%203.2.pdf) film.

The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia has a [short technical guide](https://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/guide/handbook/identification) to film types.
