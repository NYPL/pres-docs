# **Processing Audio and Moving Image Material**
The arrangement and description of audio and moving image (AMI) material utilizes many of the same guiding principles as other archival materials, but involves additional steps because AMI is described on the item level to facilitate digitization for long-term preservation and access. This section details the tasks and special considerations that are necessary when working with AMI in archival collections, and addresses identification, inventory, and housing of these materials. The Media Preservation Services department facilitates and coordinates the preservation and digitization of AMI. See the [Media Preservation Documentation Portal](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/) for further information about the ways in which media is digitized and preserved.
