Describe the existing intellectual and physical arrangement of the collection. Explain any physical rearrangement that may have occurred by the seller, and if the received order may differ from an order noted elsewhere in the documentation. This is also where you should describe materials you found during your survey that may require restrictions. It is also important to note here if the collection was processed, cataloged, or previously described by another archivist. Make sure to note the type of work that has already happened, and how this will inform your own processing plan.
