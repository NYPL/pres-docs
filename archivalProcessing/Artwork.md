# **Artwork**
In most cases, archivists should consult with their supervisor to determine if artwork requires any special housing or conservation needs. Artwork can be very large, and should always be stored flat, and never in tubes. When handling oversized works, be sure you have enough room to safely handle and rehouse items. Because artwork often requires additional housing, such as mats or mylar sleeves, be mindful of folder and box weight. 

Artwork should always be stored in the appropriate sized folder. Charcoal, oil crayon, soft pencil, and pastel drawings should be interleaved with smooth interleaving paper with the smooth side facing the artwork. Avoid placing artwork with friable medium (charcoal, pastel, pencil), paintings, or inkjet prints into polyester/mylar sleeves as it will erode the surface over time. These items should be interleaved using the non-buffered thin interleaving paper or Permalife paper and individually foldered. Prints in ink, pencil sketches, or otherwise stable works on paper do not need to be interleaved, and can be foldered together at a manageable weight.

When handling artwork avoid creating friction on the surface of works. Friction can cause damage or scratches to artwork. Wearing nitrate gloves can help with handling more delicate works and photographic negatives, but ensure that hands are clean and dry. Art encased in mylar or with interleaving papers should be handled carefully. You should not allow anything to slide across the surface of the item, instead pull the interleaving papers off surfaces directly. When handling artwork inside a folder, be mindful to not let items slip. Transporting very large pieces may require two sets of hands to ensure works remain flat.
