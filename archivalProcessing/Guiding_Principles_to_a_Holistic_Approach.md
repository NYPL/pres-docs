# Guiding Principles to a Holistic Approach

When processing a collection, keep in mind that each task is part of a continuum[^1] rather than a discrete activity. All processing activities are interrelated, informed by all prior actions, and influencing all subsequent decisions. Arrangement and description should be approached holistically, rather than as a checklist of tasks to be performed in a linear manner. Many processing activities can and should be performed simultaneously, rather than sequentially.

The Archival Processing unit works with archival collections belonging to the following curatorial divisions:
[Manuscripts and Archives Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/manuscripts-division) (MSS) at the Schwarzman Building (SASB)
[Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/berg-collection-english-and-american-literature) (BRG) at the Schwarzman Building (SASB)
[Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg/manuscripts-archives-and-rare-books-division) (MARB/SCM) at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (SCH)
[Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg/moving-image-and-recorded-sound-division) (MIRS/SCL) at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (SCH)
[Photographs and Prints Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg/photographs-and-prints-division) (P&P/SCP) at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (SCH)
[Billy Rose Theatre Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/billy-rose-theatre-division) (THE) at the Library for the Performing Arts (LPA)
[Jerome Robbins Dance Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/jerome-robbins-dance-division) (DAN) at the Library for the Performing Arts (LPA)
[Music Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/music-division) (MUS) at the Library for the Performing Arts (LPA)
[The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/rodgers-and-hammerstein-archives-recorded-sound) (RHA) at the Library of the Performing Arts (LPA)

Since the Archival Processing unit performs central processing for various divisions within the Library, the collections contain an expansive array of formats and objects. Archivists should be flexible in their approach to processing, as every collection is unique and different. Processing is very often dictated by the material present in the collection. Many of the collections are often a hybrid of materials including Born-Digital, audio and moving image, photographs, and papers. It is important to treat all records equally, regardless of format or carrier type. Archival description privileges the intellectual content in context,[^2] meaning that the records should inform each other and can be an invaluable aid when writing archival description.

In addition to letting records do the storytelling, the other three fundamental concepts that work to constitute archival description are agents, activities, and the relationships between them.[^3] This is where provenance and original order become so essential in understanding the function of the records.

Archival description should also clearly state what the archivist knows about the collection, what they do not know, and exactly how they know it.[^4] Actions, such as physical rearrangement, must be documented and discoverable to the user so the context of the content is clear if the received order changes.[^5] Similarly, archival description should be a continuous intellectual endeavor that should be easy to use, re-use, and share.[^6]

The Archival Processing unit follows the guidelines set forth in Describing Archives: A Content Standard ([DACS](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/)).
