# Collection Level
This level of description is used for small collections that may be only a single container, and are generally under two linear feet. This is similar to what DACS describes as [Single-level description](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#requirements-for-single-level-descriptions), with some additional local required fields. Collection-level processing should involve little to no physical re-arrangement or rehousing, and will generally include only a box-level container list.

**Arrangement Tasks:** The collection is typically left in received order, materials are arranged intellectually, and collection is re-housed into new archival boxes when necessary. 

**Description Tasks:** A clear and concise _abstract_, _scope and content_ note, and brief _administrative/biographical history_ note. All description is in the front matter, and if a container list is included, it contains a simple box list without hierarchy. All the minimum required descriptive fields must be included in the description. See the sections of this manual on writing the finding aid [front matter]() and [required fields]() in finding aid notes, for further information about what details to include.

**Final Products:** A collection-level finding aid published in the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and a [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).
