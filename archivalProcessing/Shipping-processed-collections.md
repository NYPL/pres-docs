# Shipping Processed Collections
Before a collection is shipped it must be cataloged. See the [Creating Catalog and EAD Records](/Creating-Catalog-and-EAD-Records.md) section of this documentation for detailed instructions. Once a collection is ready to ship, your supervisor will move the collectionâ€™s Trello card from the _Processing Projects_ Trello board to the _Shipping Trello_, and add the LSC Collection Manager and Collection Management Assistant to the card. Your supervisor will also add a note to the description field of the Trello card indicating the total number of boxes in the collection, and add the _ready to ship_ label.

Shipping logistics are managed by the the Collection Manager, Collection Management Assistant, and Registar's office. When your collection is ready to ship, you should place all the containers on the outgoing shelves in the stacks, on the barcoded shelves in room 202, in the map cases, or leave them on a cart near your desk. Just make sure you update the locations in SPEC to reflect where you have shelved your collection. The Collection Manager or Collection Management Assistant will reach out to you with any questions about locations. Be sure to communicate if there are any restrictions or requests from curatorial staff.
