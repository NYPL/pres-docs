# Shipping Processed Collections
{: .no_toc }
This section details the workflows to ship processed collection materials to their permanent storage location. Before a collection is shipped it must be cataloged. See the [Creating Catalog and EAD Records](/Creating-Catalog-and-EAD-Records.md) section of this documentation for detailed instructions.

## Boxes, Folders, Tubes, and Volumes
Once a collection is ready to ship, your supervisor will move the collectionâ€™s Trello card to the correct shipping queue in the Processing Projects Trello Board. You should add a note to the description field of the Trello card indicating the total number of boxes, folders, tubes, and volumes. If the collection is going to more than one location, your supervisor will make a copy of the Trello card and add it to that location's queue. Please also update the description of this card.

Shipping logistics are managed by Collection Management and the Registar's office. When your collection is ready to ship, you should place all the containers on the outgoing shelves in the stacks, on the barcoded shelves in room 202, in the map cases, or leave them on a cart near your desk. Just make sure you update the [locations](/Location_Management.md) in SPEC to reflect where you have shelved your collection. Collection Mangement reach out to you with any questions. Be sure to communicate if there are any restrictions or requests from curatorial staff.

## Audio and Moving Image Content
This section details what to do with AMI once it is processed, and breaks down the various scenarios you may encounter. The workflow can vary based on the AMI's digitization status, division, and origin. 

### ReCAP Recalls 
If the AMI in your collection was at ReCAP when you started processing your collection and recalled by Collection Management, then you should coordinate with Collection Management to return the AMI to ReCAP.

For all AMI found in Schomburg collections, contact Collection Management to coordinate. They will handle accessioning, re-housing, and shipping.

Coordinate with Collection Management and your supervisor to send the media to the division.
