# Closing Memo
{: .no_toc }
Once you have sent out your finding aid for peer review, you should complete the Archival Processing Closing Memo form. The closing memo template is available on the internal archival processing google site.This document is a place to record new information that you may have encountered during processing, the ways in which the arrangement may have changed from what you planned in the processing proposal, potentially new restricted material, and detailed recommendations for transfer, separation, and secure destruction. This document is intended as a way to communicate this new information, as well as notable content and interesting biographical and historical information with curatorial and reading room staff. The completed form should be sent to your supervisor along with the final draft of your finding aid, and then uploaded to the collection dossier or acquisition folder when it is approved.

You should only complete the Closing Memo if you have new information to share, and only fill out the relevant fields. The Closing Memo template includes instructions on how to fill out each field. Share your completed Closing Memo with your supervisor when you submit the final draft of your finding aid for review. Your supervisor will share the Closing Memo with the curator when the finding aid is sent for review.
