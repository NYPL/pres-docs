# Administrative/Biographical History 
Based on your previous research, write a short biographical note or institutional history [[DACS 2.7](https\://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06\_part\_I/03\_chapter\_02/07\_administrative\_biographical\_history.html)] as it pertains to the creation and use of the records. As the processing archivist, it is not your job to craft a comprehensive biography of the creator, but rather to provide context as to how the creator's biography relates to the materials held in the collection. If the collection is an addition being processed as a discrete collection, or if the materials are separated from a collection with an existing finding aid on the archives portal, it is often preferable to reuse the existing _administrative/biographical history_ note. If you choose to do this, it is okay to edit the note for clarity, or tailor it to the materials you are describing, however you must always attribute the note to its original author. See the [Administrative/Biographical History note]() section of this documentation for more information and examples. 

If you are unable to verify biographical or historical information from the collection itself, it is okay to consult external sources, especially if they are primary source documents like census records, death certificates, or draft cards. The library has subscriptions to a number of databases where you can search for these materials. The archival processing unit has compiled a [list of sources to consult](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IALH_cfVpQqFGuezhwXk8GIFglJqinsXqw3lRtqp9RQ/edit?usp=sharing) when biographical and historical information cannot be verified.

If your _administrative/biographical history_ note is sourced from external documentation, it may be appropriate to cite your sources. Citations should be used sparingly, and only when you are working on a collection in which there is no biographical or historical documentation included. You do not need to cite every external article or primary source document you consulted, but you should keep track of this information in your own notes. If you must include citations, be sure to format them using [Chicago style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html), and listed at the end of your _administrative/biographical history_ note as recommended in [DACS 2.7.4](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/07_administrative_biographical_history.html#sources-of-information). Consult with your manager if you are unsure if citations are necessary.
