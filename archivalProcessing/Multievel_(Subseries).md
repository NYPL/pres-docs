# Multilevel (Subseries)
This most granular level of processing includes description to the subseries level, with item level description for all audio and moving image materials. This level is typically used for collections with a large amount of audio and moving image material that is slated for digitization, or which was received with digitized audio and moving image content. These collections are often very large and complex, and include a wide array of format types that require a high degree of rearrangement and hierarchy to describe accurately. This is similar to what DACS calls [Multilevel Added Value](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#requirements-for-multilevel-descriptions) description. 

**Arrangement Tasks:** If the collection’s received order is not usable, then physical and intellectual rearrangement will be necessary at the series, subseries, folder, and item levels. Rehousing into archival containers will often be necessary, and there will likely be materials that require special handling, such as photographs, fragile items, artwork, and items with preservation issues. All audio and moving image materials will be inventoried and imported into ASpace, where it will be intellectually arranged into the container list.  

**Description Tasks:** The container list will be hierarchical, including _scope and content_ notes on the collection, series, and subseries levels. There may also be some folder level scope notes, extent notes for all electronic media, and item level scope notes for most audio and moving image content, often including track lists or content summaries. 

**Final Products:** A detailed multilevel finding aid with item level audio and moving image description in the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and a [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).
