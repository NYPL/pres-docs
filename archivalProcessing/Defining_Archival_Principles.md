# Defining Archival Principles
This section intends to outline and examine some of the significant defining principles of archival arrangement and description practices. It details how these concepts guide our work in the Archival Processing unit at the New York Public Library, and the ways in which we continue to assess and critique these principles. Much of these concepts are also explained in the [DACS Statement of Principles](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/04_statement_of_principles.html), and all terms are defined in the [Dictionary of Archives Terminology](https://dictionary.archivists.org/).
