# Entering Data Into The ArchivesSpace Processing Spreadsheet
When working within the [ArchivesSpace Processing Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEPAgzKzb5C8IWVkRfHy2--Wj4sMdM6XitKM4ZZiesg/edit#gid=0), there are a few key guidelines to keep in mind:

**Top Container Type**

Each container in a collection must have a _Top Container Type_ (box, tube, volume, or oversize_folder) and a _Top Container Indicator_ (the container number). 

**Types of Containers**

There are four types of containers: _box_, _tube_, _oversized folder_, and _volume_. Some legacy collections may also include containers called _reel_ and _folder_. For more information on working with legacy collections, see the section of this manual on [Additions and Legacy Finding Aids](). Electronic records and audio and moving image items are imported via an exported report and entered as _Identifiers_. However, electronic records (er), may still be entered as a container type in the spreadsheet.

**Numbering Containers**

When processing various container types, the numbering scheme always restarts at 1. For example, after processing a box numbered 44 and moving onto items in tubes, the number of the tubes will begin again with 1.Â 

**Subcontainer Type**

If a box contains folders, it must include the _Subcontainer Type_ (folder) and the _Subcontainer Indicator_ (folder number).

_Tube_, _volume_, and _oversized folder_ _Top Container Types_ will never have a _subcontainer type_.

**Dates**

A date that is also the folder title must be entered into the _dates_ field. The folder title fields (i.e. _c01, c02,_ etc) should be left blank. Consecutive dates should be entered as a range, while dates with large gaps should be separated with a comma. If you cannot determine a date, leave the field blank or use an estimated date with _circa_ as the prefix.
