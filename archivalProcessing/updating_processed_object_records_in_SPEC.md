# Updating Processed Object Records in SPEC
It is recommended that you deactivate a collection’s original container as you are processing. Once you have finished processing a collection, you should verify that you have made all original containers inactive in SPEC, and double check that you did not miss any of the unprocessed materials. In most cases objects should be deactivated from the _acquisition record_. However, if you are processing a backlog collection without an acquisition record, or an artificial collection without acquisition information, then you will need to deactivate the boxes from the _collection record_. 

Below are the steps and some accompanying images that illustrate how to deactivate boxes in a SPEC acquisition record. If you are working on backlog, legacy, or an artificial collection, skip to [Deactivating Objects in a Collection Record]().

## Deactivating Objects in an Acquisition Record
1. Login to SPEC and select find/propose an acquisition in the Acquisitions menu.

3. The search results will appear below the search menu. Select the acquisition record you need to update by clicking on the acquisition name.

4. A screen will open with detailed information about the acquisition. Select the _inventory_ icon in the _extent summary_ box to view the objects associated with the acquisition.

5. A new screen will open listing all the objects associated with the collection. This will often include audio and moving image items, digital media carriers, received boxes that were rehoused, and unprocessed containers with their original LSC stacks locations.

7. A new dialog box will open that is populated with the current date in the _When_ field and your SPEC username in the _Deactivated By_ field. The _Reason For Deactivating_ field has a dropdown menu. Click on the dropdown menu icon on the right to open the menu.

8. Select the reason you are deactivating the object record from the menu. When deactivating boxes from processed collections, you should always select Contents rehoused.

9. Once you have made your selection, click on the _confirm_ button.

10. If you wish to deactivate multiple boxes at once, use the SPEC bulk deactivation feature, which allows you to select all the objects you need to deactivate. See the section of this documentation on [Bulk Object Deactivation]() for more information about how to do this. 

## Deactivating Objects in a Colletion Record

1. Login to SPEC and select _search all collections_ in the _Collections menu._

2. The collections search screen will open.

3. Enter the collection identifier or title, and select _search_.

4. The search results will appear below the search menu. Select the collection you need to update by clicking on the collection name.

5. A new screen will open with the collection’s summary information, including the call number, format counts, and linked records. Click on the number to the right of the word _objects_ under the SPEC Records menu. This number indicates the total number of objects associated with the collection record.

6. A new screen will open listing all the objects associated with the collection. After a collection has been processed, all the old boxes need to be deactivated. 

7.  To deactivate a box, click on the ^ icon and select deactivate from the pop-up menu as illustrated below.

8. A new dialog box will open that is populated with the current date in the When field and your SPEC username in the Deactivated By field. The Reason For Deactivating field has a dropdown menu. Click on the dropdown menu icon on the right to open the menu. 

9. Select the reason you are deactivating the object record from the menu. When deactivating boxes from processed collections, you should always select _Contents rehoused_.
