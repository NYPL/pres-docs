# **Artifacts**
Small artifacts that are not fragile can be wrapped in acid-free tissue and placed in a pocket archival folder. Alternatively, small artifacts can be placed in a small box. Tissue can be used to wrap the items or to provide support around the item inside of the container. 

Items that are accessioned as rolled documents should be rehoused into oversize map-folders if they can be flattened without damage.

Archival "shoebox" containers can be used to store notecards, inventory cards, and snapshot photographs. It is recommended to barcode each of these boxes individually and not to store them within record storage boxes.
