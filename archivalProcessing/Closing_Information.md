# Closing Information
This is your opportunity to call attention to any significant materials you may have encountered during your survey. You can identify content that may be interesting for a future exhibit, may be a good candidate for digitization, or information you learned while conducting background research. It is sometimes helpful to attach photographs of interesting content here as well.
