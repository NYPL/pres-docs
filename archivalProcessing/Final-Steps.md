# Final Steps
This section details the tasks and activities that must happen once you have finished processing a collection and writing its finding aid. We have also created a [Processing Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hG8_F7jfel_-Dd1G0hH_OUBOWIuuVmnoYN3Vz-zAMdY/edit#) that lists all the tasks described in this section. This checklist is intended to serve as a reminder to complete each of these integral steps, while this section goes into detail about how to complete each task.Â 

Once you have completed processing, make sure you have deactivated all the original containers in SPEC, and that you have added locations to all the new containers you imported into SPEC for ASpace. For more information on locations, see the Location Management section of this manual.
