# Folders
Below are some guidelines for using folders in archival collections.

**Use Original Folders When Possible**
In most cases, the original folders in a collection will be re-used. If the original folders are damaged or not archivally sound, they should be replaced. Even if the original folder can not be reused, for example if it is too full, you should still retain the folder and place it inside the new folder. This is especially important if the original folder includes annotations, or if the folder tile is not being retained in the finding aid.

**Foldering Loose Items**
Loose items will also need to be placed in folders. Legal and letter-size folders have creases (score lines) along the bottom. Use these score lines to expand the folder to optimally fit the material to lay as flat as possible. 

**Legal Folders Are the Standard Folder Size**
Legal-size folders are the standard folder size for housing. Existing letter-size folders can go into legal-size boxes if re-foldering is not necessary. 

**Place the Old Folder into the New One**
If you are not using the original folder because it is the wrong size, you can still include it inside a new folder. This is good practice if the original folder has useful information included. Similarly, if an original folder has labels adhered to the outside, you may use staples to secure them from falling off. 

**Items Should Fit Inside Folders**
Material should not stick out of the sides or the top of the folder. Use a larger folder if materials do not fit.

**Create Additional Folders When A Folder is Too Full**
If a folder was overfilled originally, create two or more folders. Repeat the folder title, and make sure that the order is maintained when items are split between folders and placed in a box. 

**Working with Loose Papers**
Place loose papers into folders, keeping adjacent and related items together. 

**Folded Items in Folders**
Folding large items and retaining them in letter or legal-size containers is often permissible if the item is in good condition and is of low artifactual value. The decision to fold or unfold should be made in consultation with your supervisor..

**Folders in Flat Boxes**
Folders should be placed inside flat boxes with the closed edge facing out towards the open drop front edge. The open side of the folder which (contains the folder title, date, box, and folder number) should be placed against the closed side of the box. See the images below that illustrate this. See the example images below.
