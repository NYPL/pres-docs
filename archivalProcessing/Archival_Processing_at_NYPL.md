# Archival Processing at NYPL
{: .no_toc }
This section addresses how archival guidelines, principles, and practices are implemented in the Archival Processing unit at the New York Public Library. We situate our work in the recommendations set forth by the [DACS Statement of Principles](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/04_statement_of_principles.html), but have adapted certain local standards to conform to our unique policies and requirements. We have cited the specific DACS principles referenced in this section.

# Guiding Principles to a Holistic Approach
When processing a collection, keep in mind that each task is part of a continuum[^1] rather than a discrete activity. All processing activities are interrelated, informed by all prior actions, and influencing all subsequent decisions. Arrangement and description should be approached holistically, rather than as a checklist of tasks to be performed in a linear manner. Many processing activities can and should be performed simultaneously, rather than sequentially.

The Archival Processing unit works with archival collections belonging to the following curatorial divisions:
- [Manuscripts and Archives Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/manuscripts-division) (MSS) at the Schwarzman Building (SASB)
- [Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/berg-collection-english-and-american-literature) (BRG) at the Schwarzman Building (SASB)
- [Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg/manuscripts-archives-and-rare-books-division) (MARB/SCM) at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (SCH)
-[Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg/moving-image-and-recorded-sound-division) (MIRS/SCL) at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (SCH)
- [Photographs and Prints Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg/photographs-and-prints-division) (P&P/SCP) at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (SCH)
- [Billy Rose Theatre Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/billy-rose-theatre-division) (THE) at the Library for the Performing Arts (LPA)
- [Jerome Robbins Dance Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/jerome-robbins-dance-division) (DAN) at the Library for the Performing Arts (LPA)
- [Music Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/music-division) (MUS) at the Library for the Performing Arts (LPA)
- [The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound](https://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/rodgers-and-hammerstein-archives-recorded-sound) (RHA) at the Library of the Performing Arts (LPA)

Since the Archival Processing unit performs central processing for various divisions within the Library, the collections contain an expansive array of formats and objects. Archivists should be flexible in their approach to processing, as every collection is unique and different. Processing is very often dictated by the material present in the collection. Many of the collections are often a hybrid of materials including Born-Digital, audio and moving image, photographs, and papers. It is important to treat all records equally, regardless of format or carrier type. Archival description privileges the intellectual content in context,[^2] meaning that the records should inform each other and can be an invaluable aid when writing archival description.

In addition to letting records do the storytelling, the other three fundamental concepts that work to constitute archival description are agents, activities, and the relationships between them.[^3] This is where provenance and original order become so essential in understanding the function of the records.

Archival description should also clearly state what the archivist knows about the collection, what they do not know, and exactly how they know it.[^4] Actions, such as physical rearrangement, must be documented and discoverable to the user so the context of the content is clear if the received order changes.[^5] Similarly, archival description should be a continuous intellectual endeavor that should be easy to use, re-use, and share.[^6]

The Archival Processing unit follows the guidelines set forth in Describing Archives: A Content Standard [DACS](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/).

# Efficient Processing
In the Archival Processing unit we subscribe to an efficient processing model, a method of archival processing that is rooted in the recommendations first introduced by Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner in their 2005 article “More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing,”[^7] and expanded upon by Daniel A. Santamaria in his 2015 book, _Extensible Processing for Archives and Special Collections: Reducing Processing Backlogs,_[^8] and in the University of California’s _Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing in the University of California Libraries._[^9] Efficient processing aims to expedite access to collection materials to users and take minimal time and steps to preserve and describe materials to promote use. Gaining basic physical and intellectual control also results in promoting a wider body of material to users, as well as investing an appropriate amount of time and resources to each collection. The idea of identifying a “golden minimum”[^10] of archival processing means performing the minimal amount of work in order to open the collection to researchers, resisting the temptation to handle materials at the item level, and assessing the appropriateness of work beyond this level of processing. “Good enough”[^11] processing can also equal quality processing. The archivist’s proficiency in collection analysis and decision making will lead them to determining what level of processing meets the “golden minimum” standard.

[^10]: This concept was first introduced by Greene and Meissner within the context of their widely referenced article that is often colloquially referred to as “MPLP.” In defining the “golden minimum” they ask, “What is the least we can do to get the job done in a way that is adequate to user needs, now and in the future?” Mark Greene and Dennis Meissner, “More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing,” _The American Archivist_ 68, no. 2 (September 1, 2005): 240, doi:[10.17723/aarc.68.2.c741823776k65863](https://meridian.allenpress.com/american-archivist/article/68/2/208/24011/More-Product-Less-Process-Revamping-Traditional).

[^11]: Greene and Meissner suggest “that a sign of professional maturity would be for us to own up to the limitations we work under and accept that the golden minimum recommended here (or doing ‘good enough’ rather than insisting on perfection) is all we can realistically accomplish.” Ibid (255).
