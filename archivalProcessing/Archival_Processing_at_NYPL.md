# Archival Processing at NYPL

This section addresses how archival guidelines, principles, and practices are implemented in the Archival Processing unit at the New York Public Library. We situate our work in the recommendations set forth by the [DACS Statement of Principles](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/04_statement_of_principles.html), but have adapted certain local standards to conform to our unique policies and requirements. We have cited the specific DACS principles referenced in this section.
