# Provenance
[Provenance]( https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/provenance.html) refers to the chain of custody and origin of records. Fulfilling the principle of provenance requires that collections of different origins be maintained as discrete entities in order to preserve context within each collection. This suggests that pulling documents from one collection to create an artificial collection means losing any context that the materials may have had in their original location. Since context can provide valuable information about how or when a document was created, or what other documents were associated with it, individual collections are best kept as separate and distinct entities. 

While the notion of provenance has a long and enduring tradition as a foundational model in archival arrangement and description, we also acknowledge that provenance as a guiding archival principle is one that is historically rooted in legacies of colonialism.[^1] As a concept derived around the custody and ownership of physical materials, it is one that inherently privileges those with the greatest financial means and power.[^2] We understand the limitations of provenance as a concept, and recognize that it is part of a legacy that has consistently and systematically led to historically marginalized communities being under-described and inaccurately represented in archives.[^3]
