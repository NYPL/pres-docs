# Folder Level (Series)
This level of description is most beneficial for large, complex, and/or hybrid collections that may contain electronic records and audio and moving image materials. Series-level description should be utilized for collections that cannot be adequately described in a collection-level scope note, and which require a more granular level of detail to convey the scope and content. This is similar to what DACS describes as [Multilevel](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#requirements-for-multilevel-descriptions) description.Â 

**Arrangement Tasks**: If the received order is not usable, the collection may be physically and intellectually rearranged. Sorting and rearrangement of loose items, as well as rehousing in archival boxes and folders will often be necessary as well. This level of processing may also include an audio and moving image inventory, processing of electronic records, and the intellectual arrangement of these materials into the container list.

**Description Tasks:** Multilevel hierarchical description to the series level, container list with hierarchy, and some folder level scope notes as needed. See the sections of this manual on writing finding aid [front matter]() and [required fields]() in finding aid notes, for further information about what details to include.

**Final Products:** Series level finding aid in [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).
