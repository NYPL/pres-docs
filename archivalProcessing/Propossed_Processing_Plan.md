# Proposed Processing Plan
Based upon the collection analysis, describe the minimum amount of work needed to open the collection for research. See the [Defining Processing](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Archival_Processing_at_NYPL.html) section of this documentation for further clarification on processing methods and guidelines. If rearrangement (physical or intellectual) is necessary, provide justifications, and take care to avoid arranging a collection based solely on the included formats. Remember to think beyond the physical formats of a collection, and consider the ways in which the materials were used by the records creator. Describe to what level you intend to process the collection, and if the arrangement will include series or subseries.Â 

Typically, larger and more complex collections will require series or subseries-level arrangement and description. If the collection can be adequately described in the _scope and content_ note of the front matter, then it probably does not require series-level description. Refer to the [Guidelines for Levels of Description]() section of this manual for assistance in determining what type of description is most suitable for your collection.

**Processing Timeframe**

Describe the estimated amount of time you will need to process the collection. If the proposed time frame changes during processing, communicate this to your supervisor.
