# Preservation Issues
Describe any preservation or conservation issues you encountered during your survey, or any known issues that were noted during the acquisition or accessioning process. Also be sure to list any materials that may require custom housing. You should discuss these issues with your supervisor to determine if a consultation is necessary with Conservation or Collection Management. The Archival Processing unit uses Trello and Google Forms to keep track of materials requiring conservation treatment. See the section of this documentation on [Conservation Intervention]() for further information.

With audio and moving image materials, note any films that have a vinegar smell, severely damaged media, damp items, or items containing mold. There is a [workflow]() in place for dealing with mold issues. This process may add additional time to your proposed timeline, so be sure to take this into account when making your plan. You should discuss these issues with your supervisor to determine how to best address and remediate these issues.
