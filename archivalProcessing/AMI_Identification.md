# **Identification of Audio and Moving Image Content**

There are many resources that can aid in identifying the audio and moving image materials in a collection. Some helpful identification resources are listed below. If you are unable to identify any of the media in your collection, talk to your supervisor and contact the Manager of Audio and Moving Image Description.

**All Formats**

[University of Illinois Preservation Self-Assessment Program](https://psap.library.illinois.edu/collection-id-guide/#audiovisual) is a helpful guide for identifying most common audio and moving image formats.

The [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats) preservation site has a section on archival formats, which includes sections for [audio](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/audio-toc.html), [video](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/video-toc.html), and [film](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/motion-picture-film-toc.html). [The Museum of Obsolete Media](https://obsoletemedia.org/) is helpful if you encounter less common or rare audio and moving image formats.

**Video**

The Texas Commission on the Arts [Videotape Identification and Assessment Guide](https://www.arts.texas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/video.pdf) is a useful resource for information about all video tape formats.

**Film** 

Brian Pritchard’s site has a [guide](http://www.brianpritchard.com/IMPF.htm) to identifying both [16mm](http://www.brianpritchard.com/16mm%20Identification%20Version%201.02.pdf) and [35mm](http://www.brianpritchard.com/35mm%20Film%20Identification%20Version%203.2.pdf) film.

The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia has a [short technical guide](https://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/guide/handbook/identification) to film types.

# **Preservation Issues**
Often AMI with preservation issues is discovered during accessioning, and physically separated from the collection. The Manager of Audio and Moving Image Description and Collection Manager will assess the preservation concerns and determine whether the materials will need to be sent to a vendor for remediation. However, you still may encounter additional AMI content with preservation issues during your appraisal or inventory. Some common issues are mold and film with vinegar syndrome. The [filmcare.org](https://filmcare.org/visual_decay) site is a useful resource in helping to identify potential preservation issues. If you are unsure if something is an AMI preservation issue, reach out to the Manager of Audio and Moving Image Description and Collection Management for guidance.
