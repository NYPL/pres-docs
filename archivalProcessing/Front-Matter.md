# **Front Matter**
The front matter of your finding aid contains the basic information about the collection including the title, repository name, identifiers, dates, language, level of description, abstract, dates, access restrictions, preferred citation, and extent. The [ASpace User Guide](aspace/aspace.md) contains detailed information on how to correctly fill out the front matter fields of your finding aid. Some required elements such as the repository name [[DACS 2.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/02_name_and_location_of_repository.html)], standard access note [[DACS 4.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/01_conditions_governing_access.html)] and [[DACS 4.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/02_physical_access.html)], and the preferred citation [[DACS 7.1.5](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/08_chapter_07/01_notes.html#citation-5-preservation-methods-and-issues-at-the-archives-of)] are all automatically generated by the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/). For further details on notes that are automatically added to the archives portal, see the [standard access notes]() section of the ASpace User Guide. 

Below are the fields that you must complete in ASpace, and their equivalent DACS rules, EAD tags, and MARC fields. The inclusion of these fields is informed by DACS Chapter 1: [Levels of Description](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html) and the Archival Processing unit’s local standards. All fields listed below are required unless noted otherwise. 

## **Basic Information**

| Field Name | DACS Rules | EAD Tag | MARC Field | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Title | [DACS 2.3](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/03_title.html) | [<unittitle>](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/unittitle.html) | [MARC 245](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd245.html)$a |
| Mss Identifer | [DACS 2.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/01_reference_code.html) | [<unitid type="local_mss">](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/unittitle.html) | [MARC 852](https://www.loc.gov/marc/holdings/hd852.html)$h |
| Level of Description | [DACS Chapter 1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html) | [<archdesc level="collection">](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/archdesc.html) | [MARC 351](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd351.html)$c |
| Language | [DACS 4.5](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/05_languages_and_scripts_of_the_material.html) | [<langmaterial>](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/langmaterial.html) | [MARC 008](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd008.html) | If the finding describes materials in a language other than English, change this field to “Multiple Languages” and add a _Language of materials_ note. |

## **Dates**

| Field Name | DACS Rules | EAD Tag | MARC Field | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Expression | [DACS 2.4](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html) | [<unitdate>](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/unitdate.html) | [MARC 264](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd264.html) | Enter as a date range, or single date. |
| Type | [DACS 2.4](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html) | [<unitdate> type="inclusive"](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/unitdate.html) OR [<unitdate> type="bulk" ](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/unitdate.html) | [MARC 264](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd264.html) | Enter as a date range. Bulk dates are optional. |

All collections must include a date, which should be entered as a date range in the _expression_ field. In addition to _inclusive dates_ [[DACS 2.4.7 - 2.4.9](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html#inclusive-dates)], which includes the date coverage for the entire collection, you may also choose to include _bulk dates_ [[DACS 2.4.10 and DACS 2.4.11](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html#predominant-or-bulk-dates)], which should be added if most of materials in the collection fall within a date range that varies significantly from the inclusive dates. You must always include _inclusive dates_ if you use _bulk_ _dates_.

If the materials in your collection comprise a single date [[DACS 2.4.13](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html#single-dates) and [DACS 2.4.14](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html#exact-single-dates)], you must still record this date using the _inclusive dates_ selection in the ASpace dropdown menu. 

Although DACS has rules for collections with no dates, NYPL local description standards require that all collections include a date. Never use _undated_ in the date field of the collection front matter. Instead, see [DACS 2.4.12](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html#estimated-date-ranges) and [2.4.15](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html#estimated-single-dates) for details on how to express estimated or approximate dates.

Remember that the dates should be used to describe the actual materials in the collection. If an item is a reproduction or photograph of something much older, you should use the date the reproduction or image was created, not the date of the item it depicts.
