# Collection Information
**Collection Title and Dates** [[DACS 2.3](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/03_title.html) and [DACS 2.4](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html)]

Include a DACS compliant [collection title](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/03_title.html) and the full coverage [dates](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/04_date.html) of the collection. Sometimes the name given to the collection during the acquisition process will not be DACS compliant and will need to be updated.

**Name of Creator(s)** [[DACS 2.6](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/06_name_of_creators.html)]

Provide the name(s) of the collection creator(s). Check the [Library of Congress Name Authority Headings](https://authorities.loc.gov/) to see if the creator has an existing authority file, and format the name in the way it is formatted in the authority record (i.e. [Reed, Lou](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n91053113.html)). If the creator does not have a Library of Congress authority record, you should also check [ULAN](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/), [SNAC](https://snaccooperative.org/), and [VIAF](http://viaf.org/). While a collection can have multiple creators or contributors, you may only assign one main entry to a finding aid and catalog record. Other creators must be added as a _creator/contributor_ agent to the finding aid in ASpace, which exports as an added author [[MARC 700](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd700.html)/[MARC 710](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd710.html)] in the catalog record. For more information about agents, access points, and how to handle collections without a main entry, see the [Controlled Access Terms]() section of this documentation. 

**Curatorial Division** [[DACS 2.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/02_name_and_location_of_repository.html)]

Indicate what division the collection you are processing is from. See the section of this documentation about [Archival Processing at NYPL](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Guiding_Principles_to_a_Holistic_Approach.html) for more information about each curatorial division.

 **Acquisition Number**

All collections, with the exception of backlog and artificial collections, are assigned an acquisition number. In SPEC the acquisition number is found in the top left of the Acquisition Summary screen. 

**Accession Number(s)** 

This will be assigned automatically by SPEC during accessioning. An accession number includes the year an acquisition was received followed by the sequential order of the acquisition. The accession number is located to the right of the acquisition number in the Acquisition Summary screen in SPEC. A collection may have more than one accession number if it was received in multiple acquisitions, or if the collection is an addition.

 **Collection Number** [[DACS 2.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/01_reference_code.html)]
 
 This number is assigned by SPEC when a collection record is linked to an acquisition record after accessioning is complete. Archival Processing unit management creates the collection record and links it to the acquisition record in SPEC. The collection number also serves as the URL identifier in the [archives portal](https://archives.nypl.org/). This number is found in the SPEC collection record in the _SPEC ID_ field and _Collection ID_ field under _Identifiers_. The collection number will also always be included in the collection’s Trello card.

 **Division Call Number** [[DACS 2.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/01_reference_code.html)]
 
 A collection’s call number (or Classmark) is recorded in the SPEC collection record, which will be linked to the acquisition record in the _associated collections_ section located near the bottom of the screen. You can also search for the collection record from the SPEC landing page. 

 The call number will be located in the top left of the collection record below the SPEC ID as well as in the _Identifiers_ section of this screen. Call numbers are located in the Classmark field of SPEC collection and acquisition records. Notify your supervisor if you are assigned a collection that does not have a call number.

**Music, Theatre, and Schomburg Manuscripts and Archives Call Numbers**

The collection call number is provided by the curatorial division at the time of accessioning for Music, Theatre, and Schomburg Manuscripts and Archives collections.

**Dance Call Numbers** 
Call numbers for Dance collections are created by Archival Processing unit management after a collection has been accessioned 

**Manuscripts and Archives and Berg Call Numbers** 
Manuscripts and Archives and Berg uses the unique SPEC collection ID number to create their call numbers, which are formatted like this: 

MssCol 24586 Berg Coll MSS 28384

**Schomburg Photographs and Prints Call Numbers**

The Schomburg Photographs and Prints division uses a naming convention for their call numbers that is explained in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B00pxyjB8B5WriV9qv26hh6C9mAOeUgQIHumx8wTOHU/edit?usp=sharing). Most collections processed in the Archival Processing unit are formatted like this: 

Sc Photo [Name of creator(s) or collector(s), with added topic term if present] Collection

**Extent** [[DACS 2.5](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/05_extent.html)]

Record the extent received when the collection was accessioned. Include the extent of the physical materials, electronic records, and audio and moving image items. Extent information is recorded in SPEC in the acquisition record, and is listed under the _Extent Summary_ section. Collection extents are also added to SPEC project records and each collection’s trello card.

![SPEC Extent Summary](Images\03-SPEC_Extent_Summary.png)

The extent of the physical materials should be expressed in linear feet, with the number of containers broken down into the boxes, tubes, oversized, folders, and volumes. If the collection contains other unique materials like framed items or artifacts, include that here as well. A physical extent should look like this: 91 linear feet (212 boxes, 27 tubes, 4 oversized folders).

The electronic records’ extent should be expressed with the total file size, followed by the number of files (if known) in parenthesis like this: 2.5 terabytes (40,920 computer files).

When collections containing audio and moving image materials are accessioned, the Collection Manager will create a preliminary inventory of sound recordings, video recordings, and films. Include this total in the extent of your processing proposal. The precise formats are not important, but it is important to indicate the quantity of audio recordings, video recordings, and fils so the amount of time you will need to describe and/or inventory the items can be taken into account when you estimate your processing time. If the Collection Manager or Audio and Moving Image Description staff have already inventoried the audio and moving image content, be sure to mention this in your proposal.

**Final Destination** 

Indicate the location where the collection will be sent for permanent storgage. If the collection will be stored in more than one location, indicate that here. 

**Processing Archivist(s)** [[DACS 7.1.8](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/08_chapter_07/01_notes.html#processing-information)]

Write the name of the archivist or archivists who will be processing the collection.
