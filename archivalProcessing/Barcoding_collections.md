# Barcoding Collections
All processed collections must be barcoded before EAD and Catalog records can be created, and before the collection can be shipped. Consult Collection Management's visual guide to see how to properly barcode all the containers in your collection. See the [Bulk Container Management]() section of the ArchivesSpace documention for instructions on how to add barcodes to collection containers in ASpace. 

Barcodes are located on the supplies shelves. If you have collection containers that require two barcodes, be sure to use duplicate barcode sheets. You can order additional barcodes from the BookOps cataloging tab in ServiceNow.
