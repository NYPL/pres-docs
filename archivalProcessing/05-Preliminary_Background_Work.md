# Preliminary Background Work
Before processing can begin, you must first complete a [processing proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tiIm0R8P0A_sOH3RUKsPgUKXAThqXT074QeIEokD6uk/edit#heading=h.9z6f7bucpufs) and submit it to your supervisor for approval. The [processing proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xhqvV--epavz3_AWj0-AzC7887KnpnYEpMchYS0tbL4/edit?usp=sharing/1alJwnEJwI7oKZ_TqZas_TvMV3xN_rndl/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=108219624496366593981\&rtpof=true\&sd=trueuDiqD3R2Y/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=108219624496366593981\&rtpof=true\&sd=true) is in Google Drive, and samples of completed plans can be found attached to the Trello Cards of processed collections. 

When a new collection is assigned to an archivist, the first step is to gather all the relevant documentation, and to perform some background research on the collection. You should view the acquisition information in [SPEC](https://sites.google.com/nypl.org/specialcollections/spec) and the dossier or acquisition folder in Google Drive. If the collection is an addition or is material separated from an existing collection, you should also review the original finding aid in the [archives portal](http://archives.nypl.org/).
