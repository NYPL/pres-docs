# Folder Level (Hierarchical)
This level of description is for all sizes of collections that can be effectively described in a collection-level scope note without any series-level description. This type of arrangement and description most resembles what DACS calls [Single-level Added Value](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#single-level-added-value). This may require some physical rearrangement, rehousing, and will include a folder-level container list and minimal degree of hierarchy. 

**Arrangement Tasks:** If the received order is not usable, the collection may be physically and intellectually rearranged. This re-arrangement may include a rough sort of folders and loose items, re-housing into archival boxes, and repurposing folders if they meet archival standards. 

**Description Tasks:** Concise finding aid and container list with single-level description, and a minimal degree of hierarchy. The description should include an _abstract_, collection-level _scope and content_ note, and brief _administrative/biographical history_ note, as well as all other. Collections will be described using topical groups to create hierarchy as needed. See the sections of this manual on writing finding aid [front matter]() and [required fields]() in finding aid notes, for further information about what details to include.

**Final Products:** Hierarchical finding aid in [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).
