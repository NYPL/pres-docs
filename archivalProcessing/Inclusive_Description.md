# **Inclusive Description**
{: .no_toc }
As we also address in the section of this manual about [Inclusive Cataloging](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/archivalProcessing/Inclusive_cataloging_guidelines.html), language is constantly evolving. The ways in which individuals and their communities wish to be described should never be considered uniform or permanent, so we must continually review and critique our own descriptive practices. The Archival Processing unit always strives to write description that is respectful, inclusive, and which uses the language and terms that collection creators and contributors would use to describe themselves.[^1] The guidelines in this section should be considered when processing each new collection, as well as when you are editing legacy description in collections processed by another archivist. We recommend consulting  [Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia: Anti-Racist Description Resources](https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf), [The Diversity Style Guide](https://www.diversitystyleguide.com/), and our [Archival Reading List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WI9bAG8KKPd9Y8RFm4xYzAPRc_LLUKFg9uJXu_2ZCDE/edit?usp=sharing), which contains a continually expanding list of resources regarding conscious and reparative description practices. This section also addresses local conventions for titles, dates, punctuation, abbreviations, format, and language. We follow many of the style and formatting guidelines recommended in [_The Chicago Manual of Style_](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/backmatter/index/a.html) and [DACS](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/).
