# Guidelines for Levels of Description
{: .no_toc }
DACS [Chapter 1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html) provides an overview of the various levels of description, and the types of information that should be included in each level. Below is a description of the levels in which collections are typically processed in the Archival Processing unit. These levels should not be considered rules, but rather a framework for how to approach collections of various sizes and complexities. This section is intended to assist you in estimating the amount of time and detail of description a collection may require. We have included examples of completed finding aids that fit within these guidelines.

## Preliminary Level
This preliminary level of description is for internal use only. The Preservation and Collections Processing Division does not utilize an accessioning as processing model,[^1] so information on new acquisitions are recorded in SPEC, which includes minimal container-level description for all received content. The curator records the format types, collection extent, and descriptive information provided by the creator, donor, and/or seller into the collection’s SPEC acquisition record, and the Collection Manager refines and updates this information during accessioning. 

**Arrangement Tasks:** The new acquisition is kept in received order, and rehoused when containers are not archival, are damaged, or will not fit on shelves. Electronic records are physically separated from the collection, inventoried in SPEC, and transferred to Digital Archives for imaging. Donor/seller/creator numbering systems are retained when present. All rehousing and any intervention made by the Collection Manager is noted in SPEC. 

**Description Tasks:** A container-level inventory is created in the SPEC acquisition record by the Collection Manager, and linked to a collection record by Archival Processing unit management. The SPEC record also includes shelf locations, a content summary, and the collection’s extent. A basic inventory of audio and moving image materials and electronic records is also conducted at this time, which includes a unique identifer number, barcode, and format. Preservation issues are noted, and remediation may occur when necessary. Archival Processing unit management also creates a minimal record in ArchivesSpace that includes the collection title and unique identifier.

**Final Product:** Container-level inventory, basic audio and moving image inventory, electronic records inventory, and format summary in SPEC; and a simple ArchivesSpace resource record.

## Collection Level
This level of description is used for small collections that may be only a single container, and are generally under two linear feet. This is similar to what DACS describes as [Single-level description](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#requirements-for-single-level-descriptions), with some additional local required fields. Collection-level processing should involve little to no physical re-arrangement or rehousing, and will generally include only a box-level container list.

**Arrangement Tasks:** The collection is typically left in received order, materials are arranged intellectually, and collection is re-housed into new archival boxes when necessary. 

**Description Tasks:** A clear and concise _abstract_, _scope and content_ note, and brief _administrative/biographical history_ note. All description is in the front matter, and if a container list is included, it contains a simple box list without hierarchy. All the minimum required descriptive fields must be included in the description. See the sections of this manual on writing the finding aid [front matter](/Front-Matter.md) and [required fields](/Finding_Aid_notes.md) in finding aid notes, for further information about what details to include.

**Final Products:** A collection-level finding aid published in the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and a [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog). 

**Finding aid examples:**

- [Deborah Jowitt interview transcripts](https://archives.nypl.org/dan/185499)
- [Richard Helbig papers](https://archives.nypl.org/mss/22943)

## Folder Level (Hierarchical)
This level of description is for all sizes of collections that can be effectively described in a collection-level scope note without any series-level description. This type of arrangement and description most resembles what DACS calls [Single-level Added Value](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#single-level-added-value). This may require some physical rearrangement, rehousing, and will include a folder-level container list and minimal degree of hierarchy. 

**Arrangement Tasks:** If the received order is not usable, the collection may be physically and intellectually rearranged. This re-arrangement may include a rough sort of folders and loose items, re-housing into archival boxes, and repurposing folders if they meet archival standards. 

**Description Tasks:** Concise finding aid and container list with single-level description, and a minimal degree of hierarchy. The description should include an _abstract_, collection-level _scope and content_ note, and brief _administrative/biographical history_ note, as well as all other. Collections will be described using topical groups to create hierarchy as needed. See the sections of this manual on writing finding aid [front matter](Front-Matter.md/) and [required fields](/Finding_Aid_notes.md) in finding aid notes, for further information about what details to include.

**Final Products:** Hierarchical finding aid in [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).

**Examples:**
- [Alfredo Valente negatives](https://archives.nypl.org/dan/24846)
- [New York Women in Film & Television interviews](https://archives.nypl.org/the/24759)
- [La Meri photographs](https://archives.nypl.org/dan/185524)

## Folder Level (Series)
This level of description is most beneficial for large, complex, and/or hybrid collections that may contain electronic records and audio and moving image materials. Series-level description should be utilized for collections that cannot be adequately described in a collection-level scope note, and which require a more granular level of detail to convey the scope and content. This is similar to what DACS describes as [Multilevel](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#requirements-for-multilevel-descriptions) description. 

**Arrangement Tasks**: If the received order is not usable, the collection may be physically and intellectually rearranged. Sorting and rearrangement of loose items, as well as rehousing in archival boxes and folders will often be necessary as well. This level of processing may also include an audio and moving image inventory, processing of electronic records, and the intellectual arrangement of these materials into the container list.

**Description Tasks:** Multilevel hierarchical description to the series level, container list with hierarchy, and some folder level scope notes as needed. See the sections of this manual on writing finding aid [front matter](Front-Matter.md/) and [required fields](/Finding_Aid_notes.md) in finding aid notes, for further information about what details to include.

**Final Products:** Series level finding aid in [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).

**Examples:**
- [New York Review of Books records](https://archives.nypl.org/mss/23385)
- [Sonny Rollins papers](http://archives.nypl.org/scm/24238)
- [Joan Marcus photographs](http://archives.nypl.org/the/24582)
- [Wallace Terry papers](https://archives.nypl.org/scm/23356)
- [Jonathan Schell papers](https://archives.nypl.org/mss/24254)
- [Charles Payne collection](https://archives.nypl.org/dan/24618)
- [Harry Belafonte papers](https://archives.nypl.org/scm/29990)

## Multilevel (Subseries)
This most granular level of processing includes description to the subseries level, with item level description for all audio and moving image materials. This level is typically used for collections with a large amount of audio and moving image material that is slated for digitization, or which was received with digitized audio and moving image content. These collections are often very large and complex, and include a wide array of format types that require a high degree of rearrangement and hierarchy to describe accurately. This is similar to what DACS calls [Multilevel Added Value](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html#requirements-for-multilevel-descriptions) description. 

**Arrangement Tasks:** If the collection’s received order is not usable, then physical and intellectual rearrangement will be necessary at the series, subseries, folder, and item levels. Rehousing into archival containers will often be necessary, and there will likely be materials that require special handling, such as photographs, fragile items, artwork, and items with preservation issues. All audio and moving image materials will be inventoried and imported into ASpace, where it will be intellectually arranged into the container list.  

**Description Tasks:** The container list will be hierarchical, including _scope and content_ notes on the collection, series, and subseries levels. There may also be some folder level scope notes, extent notes for all electronic media, and item level scope notes for most audio and moving image content, often including track lists or content summaries. 

**Final Products:** A detailed multilevel finding aid with item level audio and moving image description in the [Archives Portal](https://archives.nypl.org/) and a [catalog record](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog).
