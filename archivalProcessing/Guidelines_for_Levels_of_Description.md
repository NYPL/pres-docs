# Guidelines for Levels of Description
DACS [Chapter 1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/02_chapter_01.html) provides an overview of the various levels of description, and the types of information that should be included in each level. Below is a description of the levels in which collections are typically processed in the Archival Processing unit. These levels should not be considered rules, but rather a framework for how to approach collections of various sizes and complexities. This section is intended to assist you in estimating the amount of time and detail of description a collection may require. We have included examples of completed finding aids that fit within these guidelines.
