# Related Collections
Check if there are related collections at NYPL or another archival repository. Review any existing finding aids for similar collections. If the collection is an addition, locate the finding aid for the previous accruals in the [archives portal](http://archives.nypl.org/), and check with your supervisor if the new materials should be integrated into the existing finding aid, or described in a new finding aid.

Also, be sure to check the [library catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/) to see if the collection has a catalog record, and if portions of the collection such as scrapbooks or photographs were previously digitized or separated. You should also check Sierra to see if related collection material was previously cataloged and suppressed.
