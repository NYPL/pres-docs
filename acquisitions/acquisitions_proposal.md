# Acquisition Proposal Review

The **Acquisition Proposal Review** section outlines the key steps involved in preparing, submitting, and processing an acquisition proposal in the SPEC system. This includes stages such as funding evaluation, resource impact assessment, approvals, and the coordination of delivery. 

This guide is designed to provide an overview of the process, including essential information on form fields, necessary documentation, and how acquisitions are reviewed and processed by relevant units. Each step of the workflow ensures that proposals are properly assessed, and the system helps track the progress from initial submission through to delivery and final documentation.

By following this structured workflow, staff can ensure compliance with institutional policies while facilitating efficient acquisition processing and minimizing bottlenecks in the review process.

### Stage 2: Proposal Reviewed

The funding and resource requirements for acquisitions are reviewed at this stage. For acquisitions involving gifts or bequests, the process skips ahead to review and verification of resource impact.

**Funding Review:**  
The proposed funding for purchases will be evaluated, with potential adjustments made to the fund allocations as needed. If sufficient funding is not available, alternative fund codes may be suggested, or the acquisition may be paused.

After confirmation, the curator will receive an automated notification from the system.

If funding is confirmed and the acquisition will be processed by a designated unit, the proposal will be forwarded for further review. If the processing will be handled by another unit, the proposal moves to the next review stage.

**Resource Impact Review:**  
For acquisitions that will require processing or digitization, the system will calculate an estimated resource impact. This estimate includes the following factors:
- Time required for processing and digitization
- Supply costs
- Physical storage needs
- Digital storage requirements for born-digital and digitized materials

The responsible staff will verify these estimates, and once approved, the resource impact will be marked as verified.

---

### Stage 3: Proposal Reviewed for Approval

Each proposal is reviewed by a senior-level director. The director may request additional approvals, even if not explicitly required by internal guidelines. 

Automated notifications will be sent to all parties whose approval is needed, and approvals will be logged in the system for reference.

---

### Stage 4: Agreements Prepared, Sent, and Signed

If no agreement is required for the acquisition, the process skips to Stage 5.

Once an acquisition is approved, the system generates an agreement, and the proposing staff member will receive a notification with the agreement attached. The document can also be accessed directly through the system.

The signed agreement must be received before proceeding to the next stage.

---

### Stage 5: Delivery or Deliveries Scheduled

**Unassisted Deliveries:**  
For acquisitions being sent directly to storage or processing units, the system will notify the relevant staff to coordinate with the source to arrange delivery. 

**Coordinated Deliveries:**  
Staff will collaborate with external shippers, dealers, or donors to schedule deliveries. Delivery details, including dates, will be logged and accessible in the system.

---

### Stage 6: Delivery or Deliveries Received

Upon receiving the materials, designated staff will confirm receipt by logging the delivery in the system. The system will list expected objects, and staff can mark each object as received.

For acquisitions with multiple deliveries, staff can specify which delivery is being logged. The system will automatically update the location of the received objects.

---

### Stage 7: Verifying and Submitting Invoices

If the acquisition is a gift or donation, the process proceeds to the documentation stage.

For purchases, invoices will be manually annotated with the acquisition ID, confirmation for payment, and relevant signatures before being forwarded for further processing.

---

### Stage 8: Documentation Shared

As the final step, scanned copies of invoices, agreements, and other relevant documentation will be uploaded to the system for future reference. Documents can be accessed through the system’s document management section.
