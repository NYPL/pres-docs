# Collection Management

Collection Management (CLMGT) organizes risk management strategy and activities for collections. These programs aim to make collections accessible over time and protect the organization's reputation as a steward of cultural heritage collections. CLMGT provides expertise to a variety of NYPL partners, including Administrations, Capital Planning, Facilities, Legal, BookOps, Purchasing, and others, as well as within the Preservation and Collections Processing (PCP) team. 

There are five programs within CLMGT:
1. Center Collection Management programs at each of the three Research Centers (SASB, LPA, SCH), providing risk management for collection materials in storage
2. LSC Collection Management, focusing on acquisitions logistics and risk management for collection materials at LSC
3. The Office of the Registrar, which oversees risk management for collections in association with special projects, including exhibitions and outgoing loans.

Our goals are to:
-Protect collections and prevent damage through preventive conservation best practices
-Support the institution in speaking authoritatively about its collections and its stewardship
-Support institutional decision-making through risk management
-Provide collection project management and risk management oversight
-Contribute to developing professional practice

The Collection Management Program has been growing and evolving since its inception in June 2016. In August 2016, the Office of the Registrar joined Collection Management. In February 2018, one new collection manager and two assistant collection managers were hired to undertake the Special Collection Survey and begin building out the collection management program. The LSC Collection Management program was established in July 2021. A significant milestone was achieved in Spring 2022 when the program expanded to include Collection Management programs at all three research centers.
