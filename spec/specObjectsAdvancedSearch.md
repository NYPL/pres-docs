## Advanced Search
Over 90 object record elements can be searched either individually or in combination using the advanced object search. To access the advanced search, click on **Search all objects** in the Objects section on the **SPEC landing page** to navigate to the **Object Search** interface, then click **Advanced search** in the upper right corner to open the advanced search pop-up window.

{: .tip }
> Advanced Search is separate from **Basic Search** and **Use additional search fields** found on the main **Object Search** interface. The advanced search performs a new search; it does not expand or constrain the found set of objects that may appear in the object search result list.

Select a field to search fron the drop down menu and enter or select a search term. Click **+** to add search criteria or the **x** button to remove search criteria, select a **boolean operator** (AND is the default). Optionally, click the gray **(** and **)** to parenthesize a subset of search criteria, turning the parenthesis green. 

The following options appear in the advanced search interface: 

- **Include Inactive Records**:  
  Searches automatically exclude inactive records. Click this check box to include them.

- **Do not include contained objects**:  
  Searches automatically include objects on the shelf and objects contained in other objects. Click this check box to exclude objects contained in other objects.

- **Clear Terms**:  
  Clears all entered values for the fields selected.

- **Reset**:  
  Resets all fields and clears any entered values.

- **Search**:  
  Excute the search. 

{: .tip }
> It may take up to a few minutes for the advanced search to execute, especially if the search criteria results in a very large found set. 

Click the **x** button in the upper right to close the advanced search window without executing the search. Advanced search will remember the user's last search.
