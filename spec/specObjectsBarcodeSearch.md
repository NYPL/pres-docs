## Search with Barcode List
Use the search with barcode list feature to search for a group of objects using the objects' barcodes or to search for objects found at specific locations by the locations' barcodes. Click on **Search all objects** in the Objects section on the **SPEC landing page** to navigate to the **Object Search** interface, then click **search with barcode list** in the upper right corner to begin the search.

A pop-up window with instructions will appear, click OK to dismiss the window. A spreadsheet named **barcode_list_for_search** will be downloaded to the desktop and open automatically. Add barcodes to the spreadsheet, make sure barcodes are formatted as numbers and save the spreadsheet. Return to SPEC and select **find objects with these barcodes** or **find objects at the locations with these barcodes** to conduct the search.
