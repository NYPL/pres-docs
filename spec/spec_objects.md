# SPEC Objects

## Introduction
Objects are the physical and digital entities held in the Research Libraries collection storage locations. This manual describes the elements of a SPEC object record, focusing on their general purpose and use. It does not specify the best practices for using these elements in particular contexts and processes, such as accessioning or deaccessioning. These processes, and the use of SPEC within them, will be outlined in separate documents.

SPEC object records support a level of collection management that is not available through the catalog or other existing systems. SPEC complements, references, and interacts with data about objects in other systems, such as the catalog, ArchivesSpace, the Archives Portal, the MMS, Preservica (planned), and Aeon (planned). Broadly speaking, SPEC object records allow Library staff to:
- track the status and locations of objects
- document their needs
- plan, scope, and track projects
- automate and facilitate certain processes (such as special collections moves)
- document actions undertaken by staff to acquire, describe, and preserve those objects

The goal is to populate SPEC with object records for every special collection item and container on the shelf in the Research Libraries through the Special Collection Survey, data imports from the catalog and other sources, and routine processes (e.g, Acquisitions, AMI inventory). Records for individual items and containers (usually folders) within containers will be created as needed in the course of work demanding a more granular level of object tracking.
