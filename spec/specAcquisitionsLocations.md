## Pre-Acquisition Locations
Each acquisition is associated with one or more pre-acquisition locations, which specify where collection materials are stored prior to their delivery to NYPL (i.e. a storage space, a donor’s apartment). Each pre-acquisition location is associated with one or more deliveries.

Use the **+ Add** button in the Location List section of the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form to add a new pre-acquisition location to an acquisition. Click on the location name in the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form to edit an existing location. By default, every new acquisition has a stub pre-acquisition location, which should be updated with location information. See [Creating and Editing Acquisition Records] (https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specAcquisitions.html#creating-and-editing-acquisition-records) for more information.

The Location List section of the **Acquisition Summary** displays the information entered via the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form. Locations where a site visit has been requested show a Site Visit flag. Click on the location name in the Location List to navigate to the full **Location Record** interface, where existing location details can be edited and additional location information can be added. The General Information section in the **Location Record** interface contains the fields described above. 

The Site Description section contains more detailed narrative information about a pre-acquisition location that may be used in planning or preparing for subsequent site or packing visits. Enter information about the building, site accessibility, health and safety concerns and other general descriptions. This section also includes a checkbox where Preservation and Collections Processing staff may indicate that a site visit is needed. The Location Details section contains a checklist of common location characteristics that may be useful to know for those involved in site visits, packing or pickup.

The **Location Record** interface also contains a Delivery Log section. See [Deliveries](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specAcquisitionsDeliveries.html) for more information.
