## Pre-Acquisition Locations
Each acquisition must be associated with at least one location. Use the **+ Add** button in the Location List section of the the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form to add a new pre-acquisition location to an acquisition. Click on the location name in the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form to edit an existing location. By default, every new acquisition has a stub pre-acquisition location, which should be updated with location information. See [Creating and Editing Acquisition Records] (https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specAcquisitions.html#creating-and-editing-acquisition-records) for more information.

Click on the location name in the Location List section of the **Acquisition Summary** to navigate to the full **Location Record** interface, where additional location details can be updated, along with site visits and delivery log information. See [Deliveries](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specAcquisitionsDeliveries.html) for more information.
