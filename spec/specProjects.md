# SPEC Projects
A SPEC project is an activity or group of related activities that addresses a defined body of objects (or targets) during a specified time period and that produces quantifiable outputs. Project goal(s) describe the desired outcomes and/or motivation for the project.  Projects can be grouped explicitly through association of an initiative, or implicitly through grants, activities, targets, time period, repository, outputs, or any project characteristic.

The scope of a project can be determined by any number of factors, but must have a defined start date and completion date time, must be assigned to only one supervisor or program head, and address objects owned by a single repository or division. Projects and project targets should be defined so that each activity addresses all of the targeted objects.

Managing projects serves three purposes:

1. Create and share prioritized queues for (all) present and future work on special collections.
2. Tracking the progress of projects as they move through their major phases.
3. Generating statistics that reflect what has been worked on and the resulting output of that work.

Project tracking does not aim to track all of the tasks and milestones associated with smaller processes associated with any activity or group of activities.
