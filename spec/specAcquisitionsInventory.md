## Inventory / Related SPEC Objects
Each acquisition requires an inventory, composed of [SPEC Object records](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjects.html) of the individual items and/or containers that will be acquired. Inventories are used as the basis for legal agreements, to plan for packing, pickup and delivery, and for post-acquisition activities such as accessioning and tracking locations.

Click on the **+ NEW** button or **Go to inventory** button in the Inventory section of the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form to navigate to the **Object Search** interface, where new object records can be created or duplicated from existing object records. If at least one object is already associated with the acquisition, the **Go to inventory** button also appears in the Extent Summary section of the **Acquisition Summary**.

When navigating to the **Object Search** from the **Acquisition Summary**, all active and inactive objects associated with the acquisition will be displayed and the green new object button will read **+Create new object in [Acquisition title]** and will auto-populate the new object's division and associated references based on the acquisition. See [Creating Object Records](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjects.html#creating-object-records) and [Duplicating Object Records](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjects.html#duplicating-object-records) for more information on new object records and [SPEC Objects / References](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsReferences.html) for more information on SPEC acquisition, acquisition delivery and collection reference logic in relation to object records.

When acquisitions are received, all objects belonging to a received delivery must also be individually marked as received via the **Object Search** interface. See [SPEC Objects / Received Date](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsReceived.html) for more information.
