## Actions
Throughout the acquisition process, the Actions section of the **Acquisition Summary** interface will contain either button prompts or a status statement that are custom to the logged in user.

Buttons will prompt the logged in user to perform a certain action, such as submitting an acquisition, approving funds, or marking the acquisition as being received. Text status statements will appear in lieu of a button if no action is required of the logged in user.

Any actions taken are logged in the Activity Log.
