## Actions / Acquisition Status
Throughout the acquisition process, the Actions section of the **Acquisition Summary** interface will contain either button prompts or a status statement that are custom to the logged in user.

Buttons will prompt the logged in user to perform a certain action, such as submitting an acquisition, approving funds, or marking the acquisition as received. Text status statements will appear in lieu of a button if no action is required of the logged in user.

Actions taken are logged in the Activity Log. Most actions also trigger an email notification alerting the next user in the process and other stakeholders.

Acquisitions progress through the following stages:

### UNDER REVIEW
*Status:* **Curator submission pending**  
Curator has option to **Submit** or **Decline / Hold**

*Status:* **Funding review**  
All acquisitions designated as purchases (Acquisition Means) need to go through a funding review. The designated budget checker has option to select **Funds Available** or **No Funds / Hold**

*Status:* **PCP review**  
For acquisitions to be processed by PCP (Processed By), the designated manager(s) in PCP must verify the Resource Impact of the Acquisition. Default system estimates can be accepted or custom manager estimates can be entered, with the option to **Verify Estimates** or **Verify Provisionally** 

*Statuses:* **Supervisor approval pending** and **Astor Director approval pending**  
Acquisitions that meet thresholds outlined in the NYPL collection policy require the approval of the curatorial supervisor, followed by the approval of the Astor Director, who have the option to **Approve** or **Decline / Hold**

### APPROVED
*Statuses:* **Approved - standard agreement in process** and **Approved - custom agreement in process**  
For any acquisitions that require an agreement, the designated administrator can generate the agreement in SPEC and file it to the Acquisition's GoogleDrive folder. 

*Status:* **Approved - agreement created and sent to Collections**  
This status appears once the agreement is created, filed, and shared with the Collections office. When the signed agreement is received from the seller or donor, the administrator has the option to log **Agreement Received**

### DELIVERY PENDING
Once the required steps above have been completed the Acquisition is ready for delivery.

*Status:* **Delivery by source pending**  
For any acquisitions where the delivery is arranged by the seller or donor. Collection Management and the Curator have the option to **Receive** the acquisition

*Status:* **Delivery date pending**  
For any acquisitions where the delivery is arranged by NYPL. Once a delivery date or dates have been assigned the acquisition advances to the next status.

*Status:* **Delivery scheduled**  
Collection Management and the Curator have the option to **Receive** the acquisition

*Status:* **Delivery scheduled - next delivery date pending**  
For any acquisitions that have multiple deliveries, where one or more deliveries have been scheduled and subsequent deliveries have not.  

### RECEIVED
Last step in the acquisition process. New acquisitions should only be marked as **Received** when all required prior review and approvals have occurred.

*Status:* **Received**  
All materials part of the acquisition have arrived at NYPL. 

*Status:* **Received partially**  
One or more, but not all deliveries associated with the acquisition have arrived at NYPL. Collection Management and the Curator have the option to **Receive** the subsequent deliveries.

*Status:* **Received - date unknown**  
This status is used for any older acquisitions for which a record was entered retrospectively and the date the materials arrived at NYPL is unknown.  

### ON HOLD and NOT PROCEEDING
*Statuses:* **On hold** and **Not Proceeding**  
Acquisitions that were placed temporarily on hold during any part of the **Under Review** process or which the curator chose not to move forward with.
