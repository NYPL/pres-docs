## Assessments
*as needed, multiple values*

Objects are assessed by staff in various contexts: during the evaluation of an acquisition; in response to inclusion in a potential loan, exhibition, or digitization project; and during an assessment/survey project.

Assessments are logged using the following fields:

### Date
*required, single date value*  
The date an object was assessed.

### Assessed By
*required, single controlled value*  
The staff member who conducted the assessment. SPEC automatically fills in the username of the account logging the assessment, although this field can be modified manually.

### Assessment Name
*optional, single controlled value*  
This field is used to associate the assessment with a specific project or type of assessment, such as accessioning, exhibition loan / review, site visit, or the special collections survey. When AMI film item is marked as inspected, the assessment name auto-populates to film inspection. 

### Documentation
*required as needed, single controlled value*  
Enter "Y" when the object has acquisition or other documentation, leave blank otherwise.

### Issues (Count)
*automatically generated*  
This field displays the number of issues recorded during the assessment.
