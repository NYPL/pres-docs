## Assessments
*as needed, multiple values*

Objects are assessed by staff in various contexts: during the evaluation of an acquisition; in response to inclusion in a potential loan, exhibition, or digitization project; and during an assessment/survey project.

Assessments are logged using the following fields:

### Date
*required, single date value*

The date an object was assessed.

### Assessed By
*required, single controlled value*

The staff member who conducted the assessment. SPEC automatically fills in the username of the staff member entering the record, but this field can be modified as needed.

### Assessment Name
*optional, single controlled value*

This field is used to associate the assessment with a specific project.

### Documentation
*required as needed, single controlled value*

Enter "Y" when the object has acquisition or other documentation with or within it.

### Issues (Count)
*generated by SPEC, not modifiable*

This field displays the number of issues recorded during the assessment.
