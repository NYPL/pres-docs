## Attachments
Associate documents with an object record by uploading an attachment to the object's GoogleDrive folder. Click on the **paperclip** in the upper right corner of the [Object Record](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsObjectRecord.html) interface. In the **Upload Documentation to Object** pop-up window select a document type from the drop down list. Right click in the filename field and follow the onscreen prompts to insert a file. This function prepends the document type and the SPEC object id to the document file name. 

{: .tip }
> If using SPEC via the client the upload will proceed immediately. If using SPEC via the browser the file will be marked for upload and, in most cases, will appear in the GoogleDrive folder within a day.

A new GoogleDrive folder is created when the first file is uploaded to an object record. All subsequent uploads will be added to the same folder. To see documents attached to an object record click on the **folder** icon in the upper right corner, next to the **paperclip** icon. If there are no documents associated with the object and therefore no GoogleDrive folder, the **folder** icon will appear grayed out.

Users who have edit access to an object record have the ability to upload documents to the object's GoogleDrive folder. Users who have view access to an object record can view the contents of the GoogleDrive folder.
