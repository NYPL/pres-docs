# SPEC Object Record Elements

## Type
**Required.** Single controlled value.

There are two types of objects:

### Items
Items are objects that constitute the Research Libraries collection, such as books, sound recordings, manuscripts, and digital files. In the context of SPEC, the term *item* has a more specific and literal meaning than it does in the context of the catalog, where an “item record” can represent one or more items.

An item in SPEC is always a single thing that is not a container. Bound volumes, such as a book or manuscript diary, are considered a single item, although the pages within them are also considered items.

Items in SPEC are physical or digital objects, not intellectual or bibliographic entities. For example, an unbound 40-page manuscript of a short story is not a single (manuscript) item, but 40 items (see the *Relationships* section for details).
