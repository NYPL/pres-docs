## Related SPEC Records
An acquisition can be associated with a collection through the **Acquisition Summary** interface. Click the **+Add** button in the Associated Collection(s) section. Search for an existing SPEC collection record in the **Acquisition Reference Collection Search** pop-up window using one or more of the available search fields. Click the **magnifying glass** icon to execute the search. In the search result list use the **checkmark** icon to link the collection to the acquisition. 

If a SPEC Collection record does not already exist, click the **+** button in the right corner of the **Acquisition Reference Collection Search** pop-up window to create a new collection record. Fill out the division/repository, classmark, creator, and title fields. Note that clicking the **+** button automatically creates a link between the acquisition and new collection record, even if all collection fields are left blank.  

Multiple collections can be associated with a single acquisition record, and multiple acquisitions can be associated with a single collection record. To remove an association between a collection and an acquisition, click the **x** button to the left of the collection in the Associated Collection(s) list. Note that unlinking the collection from the acquisition does not delete the collection record. The link between an acquisition and collection can only be established or removed from the **Acquisition Summary** interface.
