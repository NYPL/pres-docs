# SPEC Acquisitions
SPEC acquisitions are transactions through which the NYPL Research Libraries take ownership of materials. Acquisitions consist of one or more objects. A single acquisition can contain objects that are part of one or more collections, or individual objects that are not part of a collection. Multiple acquisitions can comprise a single collection.

SPEC contains acquisition records for:
- All special collections acquisitions since SPEC's adoption for acquisition management in 2021
- Most special collections acquisitions since 2014 and select older acquisitions input retroactively
- All Manuscripts and Archives Division acquisitions since 1994


## Acquisitions Search
To find an acquisition navigate to the **Acquisitions search** interface by clicking on **Find / propose an acquisition** or **My Acquisition List** in the Acquisitions section of the **SPEC landing page**.

Use the available search fields at the top of the Acquisitions search interface individually or in combination. Using multiple fields creates a Boolean AND search, narrowing down search results. Click on teh **Search** button to execute the search. Click on the **Clear** button to reset all search parameters.

Results are grouped by status and sorted by the date of the last recorded status change. Click on the acquisiton name to navigate to the **Acquisition Summary** interface to view or edit the acquisition record.

> Clicking on the acquisition name anywhere it is clickable in SPEC will navigate to the acquisition record. 

**My Acquisitions List** found on the **SPEC landing page** and the **Acquistions search** interface navigates to a filtered list of acquisitions, grouped by acquisition status, based on the role and division of the user. The **Show All** button, which displays all acquisitions in the system in the results list, is available to Preservation and Collections Processing admin staff. 

Information about the acquisitions in the search results can be exported using the **Export (CSV)** button in the lower right corner of the **Acquisitions search** interface.


## Creating and Editing Acquisition Records
Acquisition records can be created by clicking **+** button in the upper right of the **Acquistions search** interface. This opens the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form. This form can also be accessed to edit an existing acquisition by clicking the **pencil and paper** icon in the upper right corner of the **Acquisition Summary** interface. 

Note that acquisiton edit access and some acquisiton information, such as links to documentation folders and price, are limited by curatorial division assigned to the record and user account for most division staff.
