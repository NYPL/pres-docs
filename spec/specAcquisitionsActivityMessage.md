## Activity Log
Actions taken along the acquisition submission, approval, and receipt process, messages sent through SPEC, and documentation filed through SPEC are automatically recorded by SPEC in the Activity Log section of the **Acquisition Summary**. Each entry includes a date, a brief event description which includes the account name associated with the action, and an optional note field. 

Events can be manually added to the Activity Log by clicking the **+Add** button and filling out the date, event description and notes (optional) in the **Add New Activity** pop-up window. Users who entered an activity log entry can edit the entry by clicking the **Edit** button to the right of the entry. Entries not editable by the logged in user have a **View** button to the right of each entry, which can be used to see information that may not be fully visible in the Activity Log list. 

## Message Log
Communication regarding a particular acquisition can be sent from SPEC by clicking the **envelope** icon in the upper right corner of the **Acquisition Summary** interface or in the upper right corner of the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form. In the **Send Message** pop up window fill out the recipient's email address and up to four cc's along with the message body. All SPEC user account emails appear in the email drop-down menus. Click **Send** to send the email.

{: .tip }
> To ensure that everyone involved in the acquisition process has the same information, use SPEC to send messages about an acquisition. To reply to a message sent through SPEC, click on the link within the email and reply through SPEC rather than with your personal email client.

All emails sent from SPEC will automatically include a link to the relevant acquisition record, which opens the record in the browser version of SPEC. The emails are logged in the Activity Log and the Message Log section of the **Acquisition Summary**. Click on the Message line in the Message Log to view the full email in the **Sent Message** pop-up window.

When certain actions are taken, such as a curator clicking on the **Submit** button when proposing an acquisition, SPEC will automatically send email messages to staff whose attention or action is required. Appropriate members of curatorial units and Preservation and Collections Processing are copied on these emails. The event that triggers the email is logged in the Activity Log, these emails are not logged in the Message Log.
