## What is SPEC?

**SPEC** is an internal database application designed for Library staff to record, find, and compile information about special collections at the object level. These objects include both physical and digital entities stored within the Research Libraries' collection locations. 

SPEC primarily functions as a **collection management tool**, supporting efforts to maintain and enhance access to NYPL's special collections. The goal is to create a record in SPEC for every special collection object. Object records within containers are generated as needed, particularly for workflows that require detailed tracking, such as special collections moves, loans, conservation efforts, and audio/visual digitization projects.

Unlike other systems such as the **Library Catalog** and the **Archives Portal**, which focus on descriptions for search and discovery, SPEC is tailored to record and surface detailed information about each object. These records complement data from other systems but provide a more granular level of tracking that supports the Library’s internal processes.

Additionally, SPEC stores information about acquisitions, collections, exhibition loans, processing and preservation projects, and storage locations. These records are interrelated and linked through the objects they describe, offering a comprehensive view of each object’s lifecycle and associations.

Finally, SPEC facilitates a growing number of **business processes and workflows** involving objects. As these processes unfold, object records are created, enhanced, and updated, ensuring that the most accurate and up-to-date information is always available.
