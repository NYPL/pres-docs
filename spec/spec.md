# SPEC
SPEC is a FileMaker based internal database application. It functions primarily as a collection management tool supporting efforts to preserve, maintain, and enhance access to NYPLâ€™s special collections. 

SPEC allows Research Library staff to record information on the object level. Unlike other systems such as the Library Catalog and the Archives Portal, which focus on description for search and discovery, SPEC is tailored to record and surface detailed information about each object. These records complement data from other systems and provide a more granular level of tracking supporting various internal workflows.

In addition to objects, SPEC stores information about acquisitions, collections, processing and preservation projects, outgoing loans, and storage locations. These records are interrelated and linked through the objects they describe, offering a comprehensive view of each objectâ€™s lifecycle and associations.


## Connecting
SPEC can be accessed via the FileMaker client or browser. Most SPEC functionality is available via both client and browser. Connection options may depend on a user's SPEC account type. Working remotely or using wifi requires a working and properly configured connection to NYPL's VPN. 

Contact PCP Systems and Operations for additional instructions on connecting to SPEC.
