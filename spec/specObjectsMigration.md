## Migration / Digitization Statuses
*as needed, multiple controlled values, one active* 

Objects can have their contents migrated to other media or formats. The most common method of migration is digitization, but in cases involving digital carriers, migration can include disk imaging or file transfers. 

View additional details or update the the migration status by clicking on the current status or placeholder text under the migration/digitization status heading in the left panel of the [Object Record](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsObjectRecord.html) interface or in the digitization, description, additional IDs tab of the AMI specific editing interfaces, see [AMI Specific Fields](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsAMI.html) for more information.

Migration statuses can also be viewed or updated in the [List Edit - AMI](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsMigration.html) interface. Use the [Bulk Action Menu](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsBulkActionMenu.html) to update the migration status of multiple objects at once. 

Migration statuses are automatically updated when digitization projects are marked as completed. See SPEC Projects (documentation forthcoming) for more information.
