## Restrictions  
*as needed, multiple values*

Restrictions are conditions governing the accessibility of an object. An object can have multiple active or inactive restrictions. Expired restrictions are not deleted from object records, rather they are made inactive by entering an end date to maintain historical data. Each restriction consists of multiple elements.


### Type  
*required, single controlled value*  
The restriction type classifies the conditions that govern the accessibility of an object. These types help identify the nature of the restrictions applied, such as those related to preservation needs, content sensitivity, or other factors. The following restriction types are available: 
- **Security**: A (valuable) object that is a target for theft
- **Preservation**: Object that may be damaged if used
- **Content**: Object with content that violates someoneâ€™s privacy or donor placed restriction
- **Hazard**: Object that could be harmful to staff and users
- **Unknown**: Object marked as closed or restricted for as yet undocumented reasons

### Restriction Description  
*highly recommended, single free text value*  
Description further clarifies the nature of the restriction. 

### From  
*required, single date value*  
Specifies the date the restriction became active, the date defaults to the date the restriction was added to the object record. 

### Until  
*as needed, single date value*  
Specifies the date the restriction expired or will expire (if known).
