## References
*as needed, multiple controlled values*

References are other identifiers created within SPEC, or in systems outside of SPEC (i.e., the Library catalog) with which an object is associated. In many cases, multiple objects share a particular reference (e.g., Acquisition ID), grouping sets of objects together in specific contexts.

References are often created and revised in the course of other actions taken in SPEC (e.g., associating an object with a project), processes being tracked within SPEC, and data updates provided by other systems.
