## Statistics
To generate statistics navigate to the **Acquisition statistics by divbision** interface by clicking on **Statistics** in the Acquisitions section of the **SPEC landing page**.

The table is sorted by center and division and defaults by displaying all acquisitions received during the current fiscal year. Change any of these parameters and clickthe **Run Report** button in the upper right to run a different statistical report. Note that older data in the system is less complete.

Statistical categories are defined in the table below.

| **Term** | **Definition** |
| **Acquisitions** | The transactions (purchases, gifts, and bequests) through which the Library becomes the owner and takes possession of materials that it adds to its collection. Acquisitions can be purchases or donations (i.e., gifts and bequests). The extent of each acquisition is measured using one or more of the following mutually exclusive metrics. |
| **Deliveries** | A delivery occurs on a specific day at a specific NYPL location when acquistion materials are received; each acquisition is associated with at least one delivery, although it can be associated with multiple deliveries |
| **Containers (on shelf)** | The count of containers, most commonaly boxes; containters within other containers, such as folders within boxes, are not included in this count |
| **Items (not media)** | The count of individual books, photographs, prints, broadsides and other formats usually acquired, accessioned, and cataloged singly; pieces of media containing audio, moving images, or digital files are not included in this count |
| **AMI items** | The count of pieces of physical media containing audio and moving images. Before acquisitions are fully inventoried (i.e., when they are first acquired), AMI counts are based on pre-acquisition estimates or post-acquisition counts done during accessioning. The most accurate number is used for reporting. Virtually all AMI is acquired as part of archival collections |
| **Digital carriers** | The number of pieces of media (e.g. floppy disks, hard drives, laptops, etc.) received containing digital content  |
| **Digitial files** | the number of discrete file transfers directly from computers, networks, and cloud storage |
| **TB** | The extent of born digital material acquired either on physical media or via direct transfer. Virtually all digital material is acquired as part of archival collections. |
| **Linear feet** | The extent of groups of material usually in various formats that are acquired, accessioned, and described in the aggregate. Most acquisitions measured as linear feet are archives, but not all |
| **Linear feet balance** | Annual linear feet allocated to each center for new acquisitions minus the center's total linear feet of newly acquired collections |
