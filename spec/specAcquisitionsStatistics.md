## Statistics
To generate statistics navigate to the **Acquisition statistics by divbision** interface by clicking on **Statistics** in the Acquisitions section of the **SPEC landing page**.

The table is sorted by center and division and defaults by displaying all acquisitions received during the current fiscal year. Change any of these parameters and clickthe **Run Report** button in the upper right to run a different statistical report. Note that older data in the system is less complete.
