## List Edit Interfaces
The **List Edit** interfaces provide a way to view and edit sets of objects. Generate a found set of object records in the [Object Search](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjects.html#object-search) interface. Click on **All**, **AMI**, or **Survey** (CLMGT only) next to the List edit label between the basic serch fields and object search results list. 

## All
The **List Object Editor** interface will show a list of all objects in the found set. This interface is also accessible form the Object Counts by Format Category section of the **Collection Summary**. This interface includes a **Creae box labels** button. 

## AMI
The **List Edit - AMI** interface will limit the found set of object records to AMI only. This interface includes a **Film Stats** button. It has the option to navigate to **All Items in Containers** or to **Go to Containers**. These buttons open the specified set of objects in the **Object Search** interface. Includes Bulk Action menu options.

## Survey (CLMGT only)
The **List Edit - Survey** interface is similar to the **List Edit - ALL** interface, but displays fields and shortcuts most relevant to performing special collection survey assessments. The interface includes an **eye** icon that automatically creates an assessment record attributed to the signed in user with today's date. This interface also includes a button to **Create object record**
