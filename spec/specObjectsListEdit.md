## List Edit Interfaces

The **List Edit** interfaces provide a way to view and edit sets of objects. Generate a found set of object records in the Object Search [ADD LINK] interface. Click on **All**, **AMI**, or **Survey** (CLMGT only) next to the List edit label between the basic serch fields and object search results list. 

## All
The **List Edit - ALL** interface will show a list of all objects in the found set. This interface is also accessible form the Object Counts by Format Category section of the **Collection Summary**, see [ADD LINK] for more information. 

## AMI
The **List Edit - AMI** interface will limit the found set of object records to AMI only. 

## Survey (CLMGT only)
The **List Edit - AMI** interface is similar to the **List Edit - ALL** interface, but displays fields and shortcuts most relevant to performing special collection survey assessments.
