## List Edit Interfaces
The **List Edit** interfaces provide a way to view and edit data across a set of object records. Generate a found set of object records in the [Object Search](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjects.html#object-search) interface. Click on **All**, **AMI**, or **Survey** (CLMGT only) next to the List edit label between the basic serch fields and object search results list. 


## All
The **List Object Editor** interface will show a list of all objects in the found set. This interface is also accessible form the Object Counts by Format Category section of the **Collection Summary**. This interface includes a **Creae box labels** button. 

The object barcode, contained in relationship, current location (for uncontained objects) can be updated by clicking on the **barcode** icon to the left of the column to open a pop-up into which the appropriate barcode can be scanned. 

Type, the format hierarchy, and division can be updated using a drop-down list within the column. Extents, id number prefix, id or sequence number, and title or label text can be updated by typing directly into the field. 

The list displays the first content estimate for container type objects, if one exists, and the object's format with a content count of 1 for item type objects. Click on **View All / Edit / Add estimates** at right end of the list to view and add additional content estimates.


## AMI
The **List Edit - AMI** interface will limit the found set of object records to AMI only. This interface includes a **Film Stats** button. It has the option to navigate to **All Items in Containers** or to **Go to Containers**. These buttons open the specified set of objects in the **Object Search** interface. Includes Bulk Action menu options.


## Survey (CLMGT only)
The **Object list survey** interface is similar to the **List Edit - ALL** interface, but displays fields and shortcuts most relevant to performing special collection survey assessments. The interface includes an **eye** icon that automatically creates an assessment record attributed to the signed in user with today's date. This interface also includes a button to **Create object record**
