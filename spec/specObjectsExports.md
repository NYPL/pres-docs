## Exports
Several exports of object records are availble from the **Object Search** interface. Use the **Export** button in the lower right corner of the **Object Search** interface. In the pop-up window, specify a file name or leave the file name blank to use the default file name and select one of the following exports:

- **Object Search Export**: exports .csv file with most object record data for all objects in the object search results list
- **AMI Export**: exports .csv file with most AMI specific fields, limits objects in the object search results list to AMI only
- **CLMGT Box List**: exports .csv file with custom selection of object record data and custom field labels for all objects in the object search results list (not available in browser)
- **Digital Media Labels**: exports .xlsx with a list of object identifiers that consist of the objects' acquisition id and SPEC object id, limits objects in the object search results to digital media (not available in browser)

All exports download to the user's desktop when using the client. When using the browser exports download to the location specified in the browser's settings.

Each of the [List Edit](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsListEdit.html) interfaces also contains an object export. Use the **Export (CSV)** button in the lower left corner of the **List Edit** interfaces to export object record data for all objects visible in the list. The fields exported vary based on the interface from which the export is initiated.
