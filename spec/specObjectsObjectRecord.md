## Object Record Interface
The **Object Record** interface displays information about an individual object. Most blue text opens pop-up interfaces where additional information can be viewed and, depending on user permissions, edited. In addition to the header, left panel, and main section of the interface, AMI and digital media objects display a format icon to the right of the object name where additional format specific information can be accessed.

> Users can navigate back and forth between the Object Search or the List Edit interfaces and the Object Record interface and various object pop-up windows without losing the found set of object records. However, clicking on the collection or acquisition title in the Object Record interface, navigates to a different SPEC record type and the prior found set of objects is no longer accessible. 

Some object information is only visible in the **Object Record** interface. This includes the SPEC object id in the header, the user account and created date of the object at the bottom of the left panel, and additional details about an object's deactivation and recieved date in pop-up windows that open when clicking on the corresponding data. Additionally, accessibility, description, value, notes, other descriptive text can only be viewed and updated in the **Object Record** interface. 

Object image(s) can be added by clicking the image thumbnail or image icon in the upper left corner of header. These images are uploaded only to the SPEC database. This is distinct from the attachments that can be uploaded to the object's GoogleDrive folder. See [Attachments](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsAttachments.html) for more information.


## Audit Log Export
The object audit log shows a record of changes to an object record; audit log entries date back to June 2021. Preservation and Collection Processing admin staff have the ability to access an individual object's audit log entries by clicking on the **audit log export** button in the upper right corner of the **Object Record** interface. A .csv file will be downloaded to the user's desktop.
