## Resource Impact
The Resource Impact section of the **Acquisition Summary** contains a table that summarizes SPEC’s automatic projection calculations for the number of days, direct costs, and digital storage required to process the proposed collection items, reformat AMI, and migrate data off of digital media. The section also shows whether the resource impact of the acquisition has been verified or provisionally verified by a manager in Preservation and Collections Processing or whether it is unverified. 

Preservation and Collections Processing staff can click **pop-up arrow** icon in the Resource Impact section to open the **Resource Projection Calculator** interface to review and refine SPEC’s projections. SPEC will project the approximate number of staff days required to accomplish tasks across the following categories: Site visits; Accessioning; Archival processing; Cataloging; Post-processing; Migration (digital); Ingest (digital). Each SPEC projection may be overridden by an appropriate manager by inputting their estimate into the Manager field. Subtotals will automatically update the projections displayed in the Resource Impact section of the **Acquisition Summary** interface   to reflect any manager entry.

Managers may also choose to input up to four custom cost types not otherwise automatically projected by SPEC. For example, if an on-site assessment requires that staff travel outside of New York City, the cost of transportation, room and board may be entered here.

For acquisitions containing AMI, the “AMI Vendor Digitization” checkbox may be toggled on or off in order to compare and contrast the cost of digitizing AMI items in-house, versus contracting work out to a digitizing vendor.
