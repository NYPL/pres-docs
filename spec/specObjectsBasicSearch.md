## Basic Search
The basic object search is found on the **Object Search** interface. Navigate to the interface by clicking on **Search all objects** in the Objects section of the **SPEC landing page**. 

Use the available search fields at the top of the **Object Search** interface individually or in combination. Using multiple fields creates a Boolean AND search, narrowing down search results.

Click the **Search** button to perform the search and the **Clear** button to clear all search terms and search results. 

| **Search Field** | **Use to search** |
| **Description Keyword** | keywords across object title/label, collection title, acquisition title, creator, label, or other descriptive text |
| **Any ID** | object id, barcode, label number, all references including AMI id, classmark, bnumber, collection id, acquisition id, and location barcode |
| **Format Keyword** | format of individual object or content estimate, container type, or media |
| **Division** | curatorial division code, select from drop down |
| **Barcode** | object barcode (unique identifier) |
| **Object ID** | SPEC assigned object id (unique identifier) |
| **Shelf Barcode** | location barcode |
| **Label Number** | label number, also includes AMI ids |
| **Object Type** | item or container, select from drop down |
| **Status** | active, inactive, or all records, select from dropdown |

{: .tip }
> Basic searches by default searches active objects only, change the Status field to search for inactive objects or across both active and inactive objects.

## Additional Search Fields
Click on **Use additional search fields** below the **Search** and **Clear** buttons to open a pop-up with additional search fields. Use any combination of fields in the pop-up window and the basic search on the main **Object Search** interface to create a Boolean AND search, narrowing down search results.

## Include related objects
Click on **Include related objects** to open a pop-up with the options to expand the found set of search results to either include **Objects contained in and part of all found objects** or **Containers of all found objects**. If additional contained objects, parts, or containers exist in the expanded search results click the button again to further expand the search results. If no contained objects, parts, or containers exist in the found set of search results the button will not appear on the interface.
