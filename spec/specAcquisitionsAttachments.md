## Attachments
Associate documents with an acquisition record by uploading an attachment to the acquisition's GoogleDrive folder. Click on the **paperclip** in the upper right corner of the **Acquisition Summary** to open the **Upload Documentation to Acquisition** pop-up window or scroll down to the Attachments section of the **Edit Proposal / Acquisition Record** form.Select a document type from the drop-down list. Right click in the filename field and follow the onscreen prompts to insert a file. This function prepends the document type and the SPEC acquisition id to the document file name.

{: .tip }
> If using SPEC via the client the upload will proceed immediately. If using SPEC via the browser the file will be marked for upload and, in most cases, will appear in the GoogleDrive folder within a day.

A new GoogleDrive folder is created when the first file is uploaded to an acquisition record. All subsequent uploads will be added to the same folder. Document uploads are logged in the Activity Log. To see documents attached to an acquisition record click on the **folder** icon in the upper right corner, next to the **paperclip** icon. If there are no documents associated with the acquisition and therefore no GoogleDrive folder, the **folder** icon will appear grayed out.

{: .note }
> Users who have edit access to an acquisition record have the ability to upload and view documents in the acquisition's GoogleDrive folder. For most division staff, access to documentation folders is limited by the curatorial division(s) assigned to a user's account.
