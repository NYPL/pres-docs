## Received Date
*required when known, single date value, year at minimum*

Indicates the year, month, and day an object was received at NYPL. When objects are marked as received during accessioning a received date is automatically assigned based on the date of the objects' associated delivery reference. Only objects associated with a SPEC acquisition and received delivery can be assigned a received date. See [SPEC Acquisitions](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specAcquisitions.html) for more information. 

Click the down caret button to the left of the object in the **Object Search** result list to show the **Editing Shortcuts** pop-up menu and select **Mark as received** to receive a single object or use the **Mark selected objects as received** action from the [Bulk Action Menu](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsBulkActionMenu.html) to receive multiple objects. Alternatively, add an NYPL location to an object that is part of a received delivery, which will automatically assign a received date to the object. See [Locations](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsLocations.html) for more information. 

Click on the date or placeholder text under the Received heading in the left panel of the [Object Record](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsObjectRecord.html) interface to view additional details related to an object's delivery or to edit the data manually in the pop-up window.
