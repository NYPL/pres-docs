## Received Date
*required when known, single date value, year at minimum*

Indicates the year, month, and day an object was received at NYPL. When objects are marked as received during accessioning a received date is automatically assigned based on the date of the objects' associated delivery reference. Only objects associated with a SPEC acquisition and received delivery can be assigned a received date. See [SPEC Acquisitions](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specAcquisitions.html) for more information. 

Click the down caret button to the left of the object in the **Object Search** result list to show the **Editing Shortcuts** pop-up menu and select **Mark as received** to receive a single object or use the **Mark selected objects as received** action from the [Bulk Action Menu](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsBulkActionMenu.html) to receive multiple objects.

View additional details related to an object's received date and delivery or edit the data manually by clicking on the date or placeholder text under the received heading in the left panel of the [Object Record](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsObjectRecord.html) interface.
