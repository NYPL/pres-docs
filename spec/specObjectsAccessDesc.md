## Accessibility
*required, single controlled value*

This field auto-populates with the default value "not available to public" for new object records. It is automatically updated during some imports and updates to object records. For example, adding a restriction to the object changes the accessibilty status to "restricted." 


## Description
*required, single controlled value*

This field auto-populates with the default value "not described" for new object records. It is automatically updated when a reference to a catalog record or a finding aid is added to the object record.

Accessibility and Description can both be viewed in the [Object Record](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsObjectRecord.html) interface. Clicking on either value in the **Object Record** header opens a pop-up window where either value can be updated manually using the drop-down list.
