## Accessibility
*required, single controlled value*

This field auto-populates with the default value "not available to public" for new object records. It is automatically updated in response to the object's description status and restrictions. 


## Description
*required, single controlled value*

This field auto-populates with the default value "not described" for new object records. It is automatically updated when a reference to Sierra, ArchivesSpace, and/or the Archives Portal is added to the object record. Additionally, the field updates based on the object's format or generation (for AMI items).

Accessibility and Description can both be viewed in the [Object Record](https://nypl.github.io/pres-docs/spec/specObjectsObjectRecord.html) interface. Clicking on either value in the **Object Record** header opens a pop-up window where both fields can be updated manually using the drop-down list. 

{: .tip }
> In some cases these fields cannot be manually edited and will revert to the auto-populated value calculated by SPEC.
